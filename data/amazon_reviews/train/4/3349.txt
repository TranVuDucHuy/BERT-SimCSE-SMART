The good:- Good sound- Excellent battery life- Chargeable with USB-C- Pauses music when the magnets stick together- Good radio signal once connectedThe bad:- Doesn't chime when turning on, only when connected to a device, so if it can't connect you won't know without taking a look at the LED.- Sometimes needs to manually have the phone look for it to connect to it- Will try to connect to other people's phone if they also have the Beats app- Rarely but once in a while will disconnect inexplicably
