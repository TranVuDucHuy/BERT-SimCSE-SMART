I really love portra 400, but this pack of 5 had some strange rolls. Two of them gave me really hazy colors, the rest turned out fine. Those two were developed in two different labs, but there's always a possibility that its a mistake on their end. In any case, the rest gave me great results and I just finished shooting the last one about a month ago even though I ordered this package about a year ago (I saved them for special events). Worth buying 5!
