I needed a wide angle lens for the eos m. I have the 22mm Prime, but that doesn't cut it in some situations.I find that this lens works well with the EOS and the EF to M adapter. So far the lens has sharp focus, and believe it or not, it seems better than the 22mm EFM that was made for the EOS m in focusing speed, and accuracy.The Good :The lens is sharp, accurate, focus is quick, and silent. The Image stabilization works very well. I can't tell you how many stops, because I have never needed to use IS for still photos. I use the IS for video, and it seems to help keep down vibrations, and jarring.The Bad:No focus number window! One reason I wanted this was for long shutter night time shots of the stars....Summary:For the price, this lens is a great addition to our EOS M, along with the adapter. It is MUCH cheaper than the 11-22 EFM that is made for the EOS M camera. I am very satisfied with my purchase. It slightly defeats the purpose of why I bought the EOS M in the first place, but it isn't that much more to lug along. I plan to use this lens just for the EOS M, as my other camera has a full frame sensor.Other lenses and cameras in my kit: 70-200 F4L, 17-40 F4L, 35mm Prime, 50mm Prime. Canon 5D, Canon 20D, 300HS, Hero 3 + Black, Hero 4 BlackI could talk about vignetting, and barrel distortion, and edge to edge sharpness, but the only one I have ever really cared about is Chromatic Aberration which is VERY well controlled on this lens. The lens is also very sharp.You can easily fix vignetting, and a lot of the times, you crop out barrel distortion, so that isn't a big deal to me.P.S, I am not going to try and act like I am some sort of nuts and bolts photography expert, but I do know a little about photography.
