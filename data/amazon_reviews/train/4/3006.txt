I like the quality of the leather. Good for 3 cards. I sometimes found my cards sliding out of it. I will opt for something a little more functional though. Wish it had a kickstand or something extra. Whatâ€™s really impressive is the price. If you can grab this thing for under $12, do it. I would suggest looking at some of the more functional options.
