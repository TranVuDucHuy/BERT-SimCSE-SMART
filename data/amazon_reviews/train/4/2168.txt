This is very handy and has become my go-to voice tool for Zoom. Like everyone, my days are filled with Zoom meetings.Set up is pretty easy. Insert the dongle into a USB port. It’s USB2 so keep that on mind is you’re a current model Mac user.Download their utility and it configures the device. Then you hid the bluetooth discover button until it flashes to add phones and commuters. The usb cable is the charger so you can use any usb power adapters and walk charge it.This has good clarity but it won’t blow you away with volume levels. I had to adjust microphone levels on my laptop to maximum because of complaints people couldn’t hear me.This works week as a speakerphone with a cell phone, too. A warning is on iphones, it tries to be the default speaker and switches the phone from other modes. This routine be bad but I left it in my kitchen after a conf call on my phone. Went to my office, and just grabbed my headset. My computer still connected to the Jabra so I had family room noise from the TV and please of “please MUTE” in zoom chat.So this is connected only to my computer now 😀
