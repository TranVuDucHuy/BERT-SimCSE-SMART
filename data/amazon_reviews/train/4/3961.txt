I never write reviews honestly but I feel this one needs to be accredited. Got this for my birthday from my husband for an outdoor theater and I absolutely hands down love this projector takes some tweaking to clear the picture but I got it today and plugged it in took a min to figure out what I could hook up to....my phone AOS didn't support the mirror and said there was an issue DEXing it....but my laptop will mirror it and it is amazing to watch horror movies and let's not forget binge watching Yellowstone....this is the first projector I have ever owned and I could not say anything bad about the picture or resolution with and without a screen...the only bad thing is the sound you can barley hear it even sitting by the speaker....but that's an easy fix with a Bluetooth speaker since my laptop mirrors the image I can still connect to a Bluetooth speaker....complete game changer for an outdoor theater and I still go...well use to go now to the drive ins. Oh and one last thing idk what some of these reviews are talking about lighting because I live in town with street lights in the front and back side of my house and still get amazing picture quality. And to explain these pics I popped it up in the garage on the back of our garage door just to set it up and play with it some and the other is on the back of the garage itself outside....like I said before I was to excited not to play with the projector and these were taken the same night I got them...and also shows the difference in dark lighting compared to street light lighting
