First off, this is really good for the money. I've seen booms that are double the price that are worse. It's tall, it's long, and it comes with some basic mic clips. If you need to hold up a mic or other piece of lightweight equipment and don't feel like spending more, this is it. The included bag is obscenely cheap (I didn't know they made straps this awful), but that's of little concern. Throw it in something sturdier and you'll be fine. A note to anybody who's looking to attach video equipment like a webcam for filming a piano: mics use 3/8" threading which this has, and that is perfectly acceptable and correct. They also use 5/8" threading which is possible through the adapters that are attached to the bases of both mic clips. Video cameras and video equipment use 1/4"" threading, so be sure to buy some thread adapters if you'll be doing that... unlike me because I am a silly musician who does silly things.There are 2 crucial problems, but they can be solved easily.1. The bottom is not weighted which means this thing can wobble and shift and fall over if you overbalance it. Just put a sandbag on the base and you're good.2. The boom doesn't have much in the way of a counterweight. You can solve this by tightening down the knob at the fulcrum or strapping a weight to the handle end of the boom.There is 1 annoyance that I have. This thing only has 1 cable clip. Come on, guys. Throw an extra one in the bag, would ya? Other than that, this is great. Really good job.
