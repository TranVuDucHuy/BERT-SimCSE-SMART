Bought the X900MK back in 2012 have loved it since. The 1080p quality on that camcorder is still great, but I've been wanting to get into 4k video.The camcorder is very light, and to some, may feel cheap. However, I personally like how light it feels as it makes holding it in your hand easier and won't get tiring. The quality is a big upgrade compared to my X900MK and the 4k video quality overall is excellent, even when viewing on a Full HD monitor after I edit and render my videos out in 4k quality and upload them to YouTube.The only issue I have is when panning the camcorder. There seems to be some sort of lag when panning which makes the image look choppy almost and not smooth at all. You have to be really slow when panning the camcorder, which could be an issue with stabilization trying to do too much and keep up. I don't pan my camcorder too much for the videos I shoot so not a major issue, but something to consider if you're looking at this camcorder.Zoom on this camcorder is pretty good as well. It may take a quick second or two for the stabilization to get set when all the way zoomed, but when I zoomed all the way while handheld, it did a great job at keeping the video pretty steady on subjects that were several hundred yards away.There is a built in windscreen, which does an okay job, but it would be worth looking into getting an additional windscreen if you plan on shooting a lot of video outdoors.I bought this over the Sony AX53 due to cost and knowing no matter what, the quality would be better than the camcorder I am shooting with now. I've used this camcorder multiple times now without any issues.
