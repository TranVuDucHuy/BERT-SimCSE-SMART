This is a good product. I was happy with the picture quality (had to return one of the two I bought because another company messed up). This was an affordable HDMI cord. I was happy with the material and happy with the length.The only issue I have with this cord is that it is a bit stiff, even after almost a week. That usually is not an issue, but it can be if you are stretching it to the 3 feet. Overall, I was happy with the material, and durability overall.
