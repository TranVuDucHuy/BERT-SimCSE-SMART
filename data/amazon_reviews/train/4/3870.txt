This being my first ever home camera has me worried it would be a flop so I want expecting much.1st one arrived set up here we go. It can be tricky if you don't know what you're doing but I'd say it lands on the easy part.Finally got it working and was surprised at what I got for $30. It's not going to be anywhere NEAR those cameras you can spend hundreds of dollars on but this is a good bang for your buck.I liked it so much that I immediately ordered two more. So far so good
