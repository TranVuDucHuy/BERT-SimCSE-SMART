I have had this car phone holder since August 2021, it broke on January 16th 2023The suction and adhesion was great. I noticed some strength being lost in the tightening mechanism to hold the phone in position a few months before full break.The connection completely broke off from arm to holder rather suddenly one day rendering it useless.With that being said, the arm and suction pieceare still attached. At this point the excellent suction has become a problemWill not by againMoving on
