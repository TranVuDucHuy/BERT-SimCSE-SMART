I have been wanting this bundle for a long long time and I was finally able to get it. Now this product is very easy to use for beginners and I did have to watch some videos on YouTube, but I learned a lot. Now I will say that the camera bag that is in this bundle is big enough to hold all of your accessories, except for the big lens and the mono tripod, and the camera itself is not too heavy bulky unless you do add on the big lens on the camera. I do have to say I did lose a little allen wrench that is supposed to be for the the big lens to mount to the camera with the little extra ring (can't remember what it's called at the moment) that comes with it so, if they would have been able to keep that all together would have been nice, I wouldn't have lost it cuz I did lose that right away. I am still learning how to do all of the functionalities on the camera as I am still fairly new to the DSLR cameras, but if you have experience with the DSLR, this is an awesome product. I do highly recommend getting this. It is a great price point for everything that you are getting in the bundle.
