Overall id give these headphones a 4/5. Ive been using these for two days and so dar they're holding up well. Pretty comfy, and amazing color. I really love the case they come in, i also like how it has a sting to make it east to carry. Parring with my iphone took 2 seconds. As far as the sound its great for the price, or course these aren’t professional headphones but for 60 bucks these sound amazing. I dont really use the noise canceling feature, i used it a couple times. I can’t really tell a difference when using it, maybe im using it wrong? But as far as everyday basic use these headphones are great
