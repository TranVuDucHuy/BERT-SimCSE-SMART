So I bought this headset back in February. I used it great until September. I'm a truck driver, so daily use with my iPhone. Audio books, podcasts, phone calls, Siri, etc. It has a great range, I can even walk all the way around my truck and not drop a call with my phone in the cab. Then one day - nada. Won't charge, can't connect to my phone. The red light stayed on like it was charging, but nothing. So, I called the company. I've been a driver a long time, and I've had my fair share of junk - when it fails no one talks to you, no refund, no warranty service, and tbh, that's what I was expecting.Blue Parrot stood behind the product, and after a short trouble shooting phone call with a polite technician, they just mailed me a new one. I didn't even have to send the old one back. I got a brand new headset from them with very little hassle. Its so rare to find that kind of customer service anymore. Thanks Blue Parrot!I love the volume, the noise cancelling is very good and battery life is over 11 hours per full charge. I can even use it with Siri! My hubby bought one, too, in March and his is still working great.
