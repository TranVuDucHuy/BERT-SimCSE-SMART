Took a little time to get these to the perfect setting for me but once I dialed them in WOW. I am a casual birder and happen to have bald eagles perch in a tree about 400 yards from house. So I figured time to upgrade from cheap binoculars to the next tier. I can see the eagles so much better and just staring out my window I can birds so much more clearly that are in my yard. For me I get a bit of wobbliness when i hold for a few moments but my wife doesn't notice and says everything is crystal clear for her (she does have better eyesight). Heavier than I was hoping for but the clarity is a good trade off.
