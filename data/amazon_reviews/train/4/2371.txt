The only issue I have with this is the attachment to the vent which moves slightly after repeatedly attaching and detaching the phone and has to be repositioned. The phone has never detached unintentionally but releases smoothly. The phones charges reliably and quickly. After experiencing this in the car I purchased some magnetic stands for the home and office.
