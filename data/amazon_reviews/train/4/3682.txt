These work well and were easy to connect to my phone. I'm a side sleeper. The eye part is very comfortable, but the speakers hurt my ears no matter where I put them. They stayed on all night, but after a few nights I ended up having to take them off halfway through due to the pain. To be fair, I ended up buying a different (and much more expensive) brand, and they also hurt my ears, but not as bad as these.
