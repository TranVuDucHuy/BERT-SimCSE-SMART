Returned a lower ansi lumen projector for this one and i'm glad i did it. Picture and sound are excellent. So what could be better? This projector throw is pretty flat even when you adjust the tilt. The height of the lens is the center of your picture. Because of this, the Keystone could have more adjustment. For the money this is a very good projector.
