It produces nice sound. The bass is good. The only thing I find less ,is the structure of the headset itself. The head phones are made of plastic. Of course, a lot of them are. The thing is that the plastic structure will weaken over time. Due to being "stretched " over the head. It makes stress points that will eventually cause the phones to snap at the ears. This take a while to happen. The better ones last around 2-3 years. I haven't owned this brand before so I don't know exactly how long they'll last you. All I can say is that it is a comfortable fit and that it sound very good for the price range. If your short on cash; but need some sound. Buy this set.
