It’s not a bad cell phone holder, but it’s not great.I wish it was just a little taller than it is, it does a good job keeping the phone secure, but occasionally, the phone slips out. Obviously you lose the cup holder this is placed in, but depending on the configuration of your car and the size of the cup, this may also interfere with the other cup holder. My husband has a Chevy Malibu, and this does not allow either cup holder to be used. I have a Nissan Armada and this does not affect the empty cupholder at all.
