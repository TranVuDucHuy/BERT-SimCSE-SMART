My 12 year old daughter just loves it! Great picture quality & prints pretty fast. Two small issues: it did not come with a charger (luckily we had an extra one that was compatible) & it prints the first picture that was taken. You cannot choose what pic to print. If you take a blurry pic or take a pic of the floor accidentally, it will print that pic.
