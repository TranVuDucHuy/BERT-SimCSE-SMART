I bought two AirTag holders to see what worked best for me. This was one of them, but not the one I have been using for the past few months. That's for a reason... this is a fine design in plastic, and arguably might protect the AirTag if I lose it in a parking lot or something.But my experience is that I lose it my car, or in the house... not in the rain on some cold, dark pavement surface. I like Belkin stuff (I use their '90s-era USB aluminum control-knob thingies to this day), but if you are looking for a soft-shell carrier for your airtag then this may not be the best choice. I used it for aewhile to give it a fair chance, but have never gone back nor given it a second thought.
