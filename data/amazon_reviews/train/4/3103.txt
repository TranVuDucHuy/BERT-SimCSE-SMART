I love wyze for having a great product for the price range the image quality is great , and the app interface is easy to use . On top of that this cam has a feature to turn off ir lights at night which is cool . I have two other models in the bedroom for my dog which has been working for years and doing great. And this model is great expect for what I wanted it for. I put it in my snake enclosure to capture the movement of my snake when active but I have noticed dayor night it doesn't pick up the snake even when it's right in front of the lens ??? How do I know bc I will literally check the live feed and the snake is active yet the motion detection isn't activated . I have changed settings and played around with it but nothing as worked . That's my only negative . Other than that great product but not great for snake monitoring unless you are just interested in the live feed .
