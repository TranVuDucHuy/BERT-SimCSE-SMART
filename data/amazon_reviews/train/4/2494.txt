This item cost 95 dollars back in 2003 when I bought it. Its now 180. It's not really worth the 95 I spent back then, much less the current price. Minimum wage hasn't gone up, so its not like people have more money now, and with inflation, people technically have less, so why the huge price increase? I don't know.Regarding the kit, the larger lenses are decent for general viewing, but the smaller lenses will rarely get used, given the factors needed for them to produce good results (dark skies, calm/still atmosphere, etc). The small lenses are difficult to view with due to the short eye relief and tiny size. If you want to use a 15mm, its better to use the 32mm with the barlow to get 16mm, you will have much better eye relief, larger field of view, and a flatter field. Basically anything around 15mm or below will go unused most of the time, and even then unless you're viewing something where high magnification is necessary, you will get much more enjoyable views using a larger eyepeice and a barlow.Having owned this set for 20 years, the two/three largest eyepieces get used most, and perhaps the moon filter. I don't use the barlow. I purchased a higher quality barlow as I seemed to get chromatic aberration with the included barlow when using higher magnification. The rest of the kit is basically a wash.I have used a couple of the other filters on rare occasion to pull out details from planets, but in 20 years I've used those few a handful of times. Perhaps they could be used for astrophotography for stacking to increase detail, but if you're getting deep into astrophotography, you're more likely to get a filter wheel rather than manually removing and installing filters for hours.You might come out cheaper by getting a decent zoom lens and barlow instead. For general viewing, this is fine, just don't expect too much.
