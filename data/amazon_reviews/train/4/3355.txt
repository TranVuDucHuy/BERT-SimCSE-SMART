I haven’t used it much yet so I don’t know how well it holds up but based on the test video I did to check the sound it was pretty good. It wasn’t worth the $40 though I could’ve gotten it for the same quality on shein for $17. Also the delivery picture they sent to me wasn’t even my package or my house so idk what that’s about but oh well.
