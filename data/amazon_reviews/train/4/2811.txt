This is actually the second time that I have purchased this item(got one for my wife when she started missing her wallet). The only thing that I have a problem with this item is that there are times that it says its not registering(like in my own house) and it wont pick it up from my phone. Besides that, this item has been a life saver and might be getting the key version really soon. I should never be unsupervised lol!
