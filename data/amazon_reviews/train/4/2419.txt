I wanted something to be able to check on our new pup while at work. She’s a rescue with a sad story and a lot of anxiety.It’s easy to install and was easy to set up. So that’s a plus. It has a nice clear picture and I love that it has a full circle rotation. Also it has good night vision. I didn’t really need that, but is nice if needed. It’s quiet when it rotates so you don’t hear it when moving it.It does have a cord so that can be a bit annoying or may not look the best depending on where you put it and it can only record if you buy a sd card to put in it.Overall I’m happy with it for what I bought it for.
