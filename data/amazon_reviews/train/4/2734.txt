The product seems pretty much like the original Apple MFi cables. This lasted me longer than the other types I bought from Amazon. The original cables that came with the phones lasted about three years with normal use. These lasted about 8 months and just like the original cables, the problem commonly originated from the base of the iPhone connection side rather than the usb side. Reinforcing the phone connection side would make this up to par with the original lighting cable.
