I wanted something that works with smart life. Not that I have anything particular against Kasa, and the only reason I even got THIS one was because I still have a few smart plugs that use the Kasa app. I just got rid of all the proprietary devices that needed their own app since it was such a pain to have half a dozen different programs. I'm at the point now where if something isn't controllable via the Smart Life app, I won't buy it.Of course, then came the need for a new 6 plug controllable strip behind a stand where my 120" floor rising projector screen sits, to control my new screen, the new UST projector, a couple subwoofers, etc...This one arrived quick enough, and worked out of the box. I'm not a fan of having to connect to the program's wireless to get it seen by the app, but at least it works consistently. I prefer apps that find their devices without going through that step.Each switch came up as its own addressable device, and the integration with Alexa was fine as I already had it set up for the existing Kasa plugs I still use that I haven't replaced yet. No issues with the voice control now.Well constructed, solid, no noise of anything rattling around inside like some of the cheaper ones have.I just wish it wasn't quite so pricey, but you get what you pay for and I wanted something that I could trust would work for more than a week or two. My Kasa devices have proven to be very reliable so far so I expect no less from this.
