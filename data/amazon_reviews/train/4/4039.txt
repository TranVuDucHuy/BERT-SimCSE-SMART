So everything you’ve probably seen in video reviews is true: surprisingly good stabilization, crazy small and lightweight, very convenient…And while the camera itself is waterproof… the case IS NOT! I did not go swimming with the thing, actually it was the reason that killed the case. Well say that I loved this camera until that point. Also app for this is incredible. Just wish there was a removal as cats or something as an alternative
