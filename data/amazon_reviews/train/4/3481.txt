I've had a few pairs of Galaxy Buds before deciding to switch to the Raycon Everyday buds. I decided to switch over to save money because the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. No regrets! These earbuds are awesome. They are miles better than all of the Samsung Buds I've had. Everything is just better. The sound, the fit, the ANC, the Awareness Mode... Considering the Raycons average about $150 cheaper than the more up-to-date Samsung Buds, I thought it would be better in some ways, but not all...My only complaint, and the only thing that keeps it from getting a full five stars from me personally, is I wish there were an app to toggle all the settings rather than having to rely on pushing/holding the buttons down.
