I guess I didn't read anywhere where it said I needed to get a micro usb type c to hdmi adapter. Since I want to hook it up to my Android phone I have to have special connection devices. So my review is only half written I have my connection stuff on the way today soon as it comes in then I can finish up my review so far though, it came in a timely manner handled with care, lots of packaging. I turned it on and it already was pretty warm within 5 minutes which concerns me a little bit. I do like that it comes with a cloth screen.EDIT:I bought the wrong HDMI adapter, I guess so I will have to return this one and buy a different one that connects. Stay tuned.Works great!This is what you need ðŸ‘‡ to connect to Android phone2-in-1 USB C Type C/Micro USB... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN8Z6QX?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share
