Was hesitant to believe these would work but they do.I can’t tell you if the charge times are impacted or not but our devices are charging.We have not experienced and unusual wear and tear, connector problems into power plugs for wall plugs or “accessory not compatible” error messages on our smart devices.Side benefit if that it reduces the wear and tear on your charge port.Has not worked with all models of phone cases though as it does need some clearance to fit.
