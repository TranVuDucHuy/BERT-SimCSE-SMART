I got this cable to have as an extra cable in case I needed to bring my work PC home and work from home. The first time I used it the picture jittered just enough to cause a bit of an eye strain. However, when I moved the cable from being connected a switch that was connected to a monitor, to the monitor itself it worked fine. So it may be the cable isnt compatible to be used with switches, I am unsure. Overall very please with the product though.
