So, I got these from Santa primarily for birdwatching. We have a wintering hummer, an adult male Rufous, here in Florida. I can watch him from my kitchen windows but wanted to get some good photos. The phone attachment is great..using voice command to operate the camera makes it a snap..particularly with this skittish hummingbird... because it is a little heavy for me a weak female..tehehe..holding the binoculars and activating the shutter manually is difficult. .eill probably get a tripod at some point. The Mr. Researched different options and decided on these for value and quality..the lifetime warranty is a plus..hope they as a young company do well...the optics are very good. A friend who has a Vortex Viper an avid birdwatcher and good photographer was very impressed at the quality of the photo i was able to get using a phone attachment with these binoculars. Will update in a few months but am tickled pink with these HD binoculars.
