I got this frame for me, not grandpa, and i am returning it. It has a lot of things going for it, hence the 4 starts. Screen is great, software is only good for grandpa.The screen is great. It has all features you want. It is very good resolution. Surprisingly, you don’t find many 6MP screens around to show your 10MP pictures. It is fairly large, it has a thin bezel.And it is cheap for the hardware you get.The software is too basic for me, though. I have library of 30 years of pictures, about 1,000, that i manage from my computer. And that is not what this is made for.My main issue is that it does not show the date the picture was taken (or the location, or any caption). I.e. it does not read the exif, the information that your camera automatically adds to any picture you take. You can only show the date you sent the picture to the frame. Which is great when you send grandpa the picture you just took, but not if you want to show a range if 30 years if pictures.And it does not connect directly to your computer or phone at home. All it does via wifi is connect to the company server. You send the pictures to them and they send to the frame. Which means you do not manage the frame through your wifi, you cannot delete pictures, see what pictures are there or change any settings through wifi. It also means that the only way you can upload more than a handful of pictures is to put them on a micro sd card and physically put it in the frame. Which is exactly what i wanted to avoid by getting a wifi frame. (Yes, you can also physically connect to the frame if you take the pc to the frame or the frame and power brick from the wall to to the pc).I also don’t like the idea of sending pictures to some company to get them on the frame that is 3 feet from me. It has privacy implications, and it will stop working if the company decides to stop supporting it (or if it goes bankrupt).Hope this helps.
