Bought this for my 10yr old daughter for her 10th birthday and she has really enjoyed it. She has had fun scrapbooking and capturing events with family and friends.Pro: Love that she can have the picture right there and then in hand. Has inspired her creative side and you can get different border patterns which I'd fun.Con: The pictures quality is good but not a high dpi so not very sharp (which we knew when buying the camera), and sometimes on the rare occasion the photo comes out blank.Overall: Great package and one I would recommend if you are looking for a fun poloroid camera.
