Got this for my science-minded daughter. This works by downloading an app, and using your phone as the camera and monitor for the scope. The pictures are clearer than I expected.So far, it is working fine, it isn't terribly sturdy, but it gets the job done.So far the biggest issue would be a long charging time for limited use time. It has its own rechargeable battery, and it won't work plugged in, only with its own battery. Be sure and charge it after every use, especially if you use the LED illuminator, or you will get frustrated when it shuts off.Overall, as a low priced starter microscope, it fills the bill. If she gets into it more, we can always upgrade. For the $10 I gave for it, I am actually impressed.
