I got this for my daughter who needed a power strip for her desk that was about 8ft away from the closet AC outlet. Most power strips are 6ft long or shorter but this is 10ft long, which is very long and more than enough for her need. It has 8 3 prong AC outlets and 3 USB ports.I love that 8 AC outlets are divided into 2 sides in 90 degrees because this allows me to plug in big plugs on the side and they are nicely spaced out from each other. I do also appreciate the 3 USB ports since she has few chargers that can be plugged directly into USB port, which saves her needing to use wall charging adapter and one AC outlet. I also love that this has flat wall plug as well as 10ft long nylon braided cable, which is much more flexible yet stronger than traditional PVC cables.However, I did find that 10ft nylon braided cable is much thinner than typical braided cables for extension cords and power strips. I wish it was bit thicker. Hopefully this is not a big issue and won't cause any problem. Finally, it would have been awesome if it had at least 1 USB-C port rather than just all USB-A port, but this is very minor and not a deal breaker. Overall, I'm very happy with this surge protector power strip and do recommend it!
