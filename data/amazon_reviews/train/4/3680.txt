I love these mask and I did by one for my Mom, however I couldn't give it a 5 because of the uncomfortable indentation on the side of my head and ear. I woke up sore on my ears and head. Not so happy with that. With more padding in that area. A5 all the way as the are so comfy and fit perfectly with the velcro. Just watch your hair. I use a cap to put it on and then slip the cap off. It works keeping your lung hair in place and acts as a cap. Double bonus. I just can't where them to sleep until after I removed the speaker. Thankfully. I have their sunglasses and they are perfect as well. It's total black out. Perfect. With perfect sound and control of sound. Highly recommended. Just be aware of your sensitivity to impressions made easily. For me it's only because I am a TBI survivor and highly sensitive on my skull. Not everyone will feel uncomfortable. It's the only reason I have a 4. I hope purple like myself that read reviews and trust them. Wanted to just give a heads up before. I had mine adjusted/ taken out. And i love, love, love them. Helps block outside sounds as well. Great product. Well made. Have bought 2 already and intend to buy more for gifts.
