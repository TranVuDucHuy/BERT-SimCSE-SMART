Good considering its low price. It only fits three cards. Also I note that it is very difficult to get out the cards no matter how many cards I have in the slot. I purchased this to for travel use only to travel light, so overall am happy with the purchase. But I wouldn't use this for a daily use just because it is so difficult to get out the cards from the slot.
