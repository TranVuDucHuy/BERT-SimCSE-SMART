Should have known I would get the one affected the known corruption issue - the second time this has happened with Sony cards on Amazon! Now I have to go through the hassle of RMAing the stupid thing and waiting for that whole process to complete. Out of all the things I've ordered lately, this is the single item that arrived on-time, so thanks for getting this defective item out so quickly!* * *9/14/2020 Update...Now that the card has been replaced, I can comment on its actual performance (incidentally, dealing with Sony on the return is pretty straightforward and took about 11 days to complete, the bulk of the time being lost while the package sat around at a FedEx facility for 5 days with no movement whatsoever).The card itself performs as advertised and works very reliably on a GH5 recording in 400/MB/s All-I format, even if the fit in the card slot is ever so slightly tight. The card itself does feel quite stout, almost as if the shell is like a metallized plastic or ceramic material, feels heavier, and sounds different than a regular plastic SD card if dropped on a table (weird thing to notice, I know, but there it is). I have a an assortment of these Sony UHS-II cards, some of which have supposedly been affected by the file corruption issue, but none of which ever failed in actual use, and all of which have since been replaced out of an abundance of caution. Except for the hassle of having return those effected by the recall, I think these UHS-II cards by Sony are worth the cost given the price.The question is, though, do you really need a ruggedized SD card that's 18x stronger than other cards that's also IP68 rated? Probably not, but for those shooting in harsh conditions or who constantly fumble their SD cards into the ocean or your aunt's famous piping hot lasagna, this might well be the card for you. For anyone else, however, the regular version at the same speed rating may work just as well (and the 120MB/s and 100MB/s cards from Sony do equally well in a GH5 recording All-I, just so you know).To be completely honest, even though I needed a large SD card, I purchased this particular one mainly out of curiosity. The way I figure, if I happen to be filming during a flight that crashes into the ocean, the FAA can probably recover the card from the depths to help determine what went wrong, so it could be money well spent!
