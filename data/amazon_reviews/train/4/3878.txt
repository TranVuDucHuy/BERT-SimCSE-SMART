Set up was extremely easy for me, being new to the hobby. Using a polar finder app really helps. Once I got everything balanced out, it worked like a champ. The declination bracket is a must. It mounted right up to my davis and sanford tripod. For the value this thing is amazing.Now for the but...I am docking it one star because the app, while it works is next to useless for DSLR control. I hooked up my camera through the snap port, no issues controlling the camera overall, however the app does not actually function as an intervalometer, only a timed single trigger pulse. Why is this bad?....because you're limited to the longest programmed shutter speed of the camera, which in most cases is 30 seconds. It will not hold the shutter open for you. So I literally have no use for the app, or the shutter cable I purchased. I simply used my own intervalometer.It works, it's simple, it's cheap and it's great. Overall I love it.
