When I am talking, since the ear cup is larger, I can hear my own voice more distorted than in the case of my previous ones, the C320 and C3225. That makes me feel less comfortable.Sound quality of the headphones:clear voice, and the quality of music is about same as C320 and C3225.I am not sure about the quality of sound at the receiving end, and the effect of "noise cancellation" of the microphone. Nonetheless, no one I talked to on the other end of the phone / voice call, ever complained about the sound quality they received, when I am this product on my computer, or on my mobile phone, indoor or outdoor.
