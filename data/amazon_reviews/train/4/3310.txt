This is a good value for the money, but had some issues... we had to return it once since a pile was missing a piece. The next set one of the poles had another pome that is suppose to expand the height stuck inside. We used a screwdriver and hammer to get it out.Next one if the soft boxes didnâ€™t work. It was the electrical component, not the bulb. We could not return it again for a replacement, but the company sent out a new soft box light at no charge as a replacement. It was a little different but gets the job done. The green screen is thin so light can come through the back and wrinkles easily.But since this was a gift for a teenager just getting started with photography and film it was a good deal to get all the equipment. Just make sure to check it all out right away.
