Quick review after 2 days.Pros: Brightness, clarity, just the overall picture quality -- whether you're watching movie, streaming videos, or playing games. And 120hz at 1080P for gaming is truly impressive -- super fluid, and virtually no input lag...the responsiveness is simply night and day compared to other non-gaming projectors in the same price range i've used. And it's super easy to setup, the settings are easy to navigate.Cons: No built-in OS of any kind, so you'll have to rely strictly on external sources -- fine for me since i hooked it up to my mediacenter/gaming PC, but if you want the likes of built-in netflix or hulu -- look elsewhere...no auto-focusing...zoom feature is negligible...image quality in HDR mode was strangely washed out -- but that could just be a Windows thing, we all know how bad HDR implementation in win10 is
