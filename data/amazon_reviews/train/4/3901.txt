I used this device to transfer all of my old home VHS tapes with little to no issues (Probably 30-40 half-hour tapes, some 30+years old.) The software is buggy (at least on Windows 10) so I only used it for recording. It crashed constantly if I tried to do anything else: editing, color correction, even saving a "project." I don't know why you would use this outdated software to edit and trim instead of a video editor anyway, but other than that for the sole purpose of capturing video and audio it worked for me. No problems with the hardware, either. The video quality looks identical to the tapes, take that however you may. Overall I would recommend this.
