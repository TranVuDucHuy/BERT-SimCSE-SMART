Nice quality picture display, love that you can swipe forward and backward. What I really dislike is the difficulty in doing setup and the fact it won't display directly from external memory media. This limits the versatility and ability to see whatever you want when you want, without uploading the files to the frame's internal memory. That is, its internal memory is limited and you have to download external files to the internal memory of the frame to display them. I don't remember for sure - it's about 28 gig. So, you can't continually keep inserting more micro cards with additional photos you want to run for a while without deleting stuff, and you can't put a giant memory file in it and run say, 2500 of your pix because internal storage won't hold it. Lastly, I have no need for all the features for sharing with family, facebook friends, and so forth on the internet. I just want to have it running in my house to remind me of my vacations, family, and pets. The rest of that sharing stuff is not for me, but the frame seems to almost insist that you connect it to the internet. Some of those features are for younger people and the facebook crowd.I will say that Customer Service was very accomodating and wanted to be sure I was satisfied with the purchase.
