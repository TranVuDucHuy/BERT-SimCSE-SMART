I had a YI camera which no longer supported the local SD card. I assume the updated software took that feature out. Wanting to monitor the front of my home I went about looking for a camera on Amazon. Since I was using the Kasa app for my remote AC modules, I looked for one of their cameras. Wanting to start as inexpensively as possible, I purchased this camera model EC60.Now I have an iphone se 2nd generation, and knowing how to connect to my home internet I wasn't expecting any problems. I was wrong. After trying several attempts and not being able to connect, I decided to use tp-link.com/support. I clicked for a live agent and to my surprise got immediately connected. The support person tried everything I did and was also unsuccessful, then asked if I had another phone. My wife's phone is a Samsung Android and so I proceeded to connect with it. It worked immediately. It looks like Kasa's support for the iphone, at least my model, doesn't work. However after I configured the camera's connection to my home Internet using my wife's Samsung, I could then use my iphone to set all the options for using the camera. It works great on both Android and iOS. BTW the iOS version of my iphone is the latest (?) 16.1.1.I love the camera. It's easy to setup the options you want and to record 24/7. I shut off all notifications and record at 720p using a 32GB SD card. Goodbye Yi, Hello Kasa!
