I was looking for an affordable pair of earphones that I didn’t have to stuff in my pocket each time I took them off, and these fit the bill! I love that I can just hang them around my neck when not listening to them.I haven’t had a pair in quite sometime so judging on sound quality comparison is difficult, but I think they sound great!They are easy to use and comfortable.It was simple to pair them with my iPhone.I also love the blue color I chose. It makes them easy to find and know they are mine.Overall I am quite happy with my choice.
