My car radio died and I was dreading a l-o-n-g car ride that I couldn't imagine driving without music. So I thought why not buy a Portable Bluetooth Speakers Wireless Speaker. I came across this item during a lengthy search and thought at $40, why not give it a try. Honestly, I set my expectations really low and prepared myself for a long drive with iffy audio. Whoa! Boy was I WRONG. This unit is terrific in a closed area like a small room/area (works great in a carâ€“and I saved a fortune over a car repair) but also pumps out enough quality sound for outdoor use. If your source allows you to use equalizer settings you can model the sounds even more and improve your listening experience.
