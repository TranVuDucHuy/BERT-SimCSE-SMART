I found it easy to set up and pair. I haven't used it with phone calls yet. I think it is difficult to find and adjust the volumn when you have it on. It doesn't fit me particularly well as I have gaps under my eyes because I have to strap it low on the back of my head for the audio to fit over my ears. It tends to make me hot after a while. It is great for listening to books or music while falling to sleep and not disturbing your partner.
