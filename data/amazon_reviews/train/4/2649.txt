Bought Weebill s pro kit. Great set up but ultimately returned due to compatability issues with my Samsung s21. After wifi connection, firmware update, youtube videos and product support contact, was not able to view camera picture in phone camera. Also tried latest version iPad and same results. Product customer support is in China. Their domestic number did not work but they responded to my email. Their suggestion still resulted no camera picture transfer to camera phone. Great gimbel system with everything else working as it states but without that feature, I wasn't able to enjoy product.
