I purchased this tripod stick specifically for the locking closures on the telescoping rods. I am pleased. I am delighted with the Bluetooth connectivity of the remote to my android phone. I have used a couple of quick release snaps on short tethers. One setup is to tether the camera holder to the stick. The other is to tether a pair of women's rubber hair bands to the tripod legs at their base, (this to hold the legs closed until needed) . In use, the camera holder can remain tethered, or detached, if I so desire. The hair elastic bands are going to be tethered to a tripod leg so that when I slip them off the tripod legs, I do not need to put them in my pocket. They may get a bit dirty, but the selfie stick is a tool, not a jewel.
