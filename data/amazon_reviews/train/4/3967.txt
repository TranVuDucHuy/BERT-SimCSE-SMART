so far so good! It's a bit noisy but the sound, picture quality, and ease of use are very good considering I paid only 100 dollars. it works very easily with apple products and Netflix. I didn't try to connect via bluetooth yet so can't comment on that but it has the feature. Also picture size is adjustable . so great for outdoor and indoor use....
