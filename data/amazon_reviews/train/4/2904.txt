I was pleasantly surprised with these headphones. I'm a college student and got them to be able to focus more in the library on campus. So far, they've been great! I don't even need to use the ANC function in my dorm room since the headphones with music are enough to keep out some background noise. My only complaint is that I can't get them to pair with my laptop through Bluetooth, just my phone. They come with a headphone jack that I have been using, but it would be nice to be able to listen to lectures while cleaning my room. Overall, I love these, already recommended them to my friends. The rose gold color is so pretty!
