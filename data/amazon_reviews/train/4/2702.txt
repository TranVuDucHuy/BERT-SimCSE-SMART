I purchased this for me, to have some fun, but isn't very well performing, I've only tried it out for 2 days and I sent it back, this will make an excellent gift for a kid, but not so much for adults. The magnifying power isn't what I was looking for, and you have to be extremely slow and careful operating it, and even then, I feel it wasn't performing as I was expecting.
