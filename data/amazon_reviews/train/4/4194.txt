So, when using this product, you have to make sure that your phone is positioned in a specific spot or the lights will bling green and blue, indicating that it is not placed correctly. Sometimes, it takes a few tries. As someone who is quite familiar with wireless charging, this has been an annoyance to me. The watch charger cradle requires that you have the actual watch charger, place it in the frame, wind it within the panel of the charger and place your watch on it. So, if you don't have an actual watch charger, this will not serve you. The only redeeming quality on this is that the headphone charger works. I don't recommend it. Rather you use the Magsafe charger or one of the many other ones that isn't this one.
