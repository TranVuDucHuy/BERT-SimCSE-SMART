I use this projector for my only source of TV and have been using it everyday.Pros- picture quality is good and you can see the picture without having to shut off the lights.Cons- it's not wireless or Bluetooth capable! I have owned another projector in the past that was cheap and that had both of those. If I would have known I couldn't hook anything wireless to it , I would have not purchased it.If you are using a firestick then you can hook the speakers to that. Sound is not good and you will absolutely need a set of speakers.I wish the keystone settings would allow you to have it off centered such as a corner so you don't have to have it right in the middle.Overall it's a great product but know your setup and make sure that works with you. I am with other people on it does check all the boxes but also forgot to check the basic ones. I still give it a good rating because at the end of the day it's giving me a good picture quality
