I have used this headset for 5 years while raiding from a call center to now only Teams or Zoom calls. Great quality and easy set up. The headset is comfortable with low profile and not bulky which is very important when on long calls.The only issue is the battery life. The battery life seems to vary from 3-5 hours instead of the 6 it states. After every call as good practice I place back in charger so I can handle a full 8 hour shift.
