Â The pros, this small thing was built to do just about anything. You can take it anywhere no problem! You can shoot for several angles and video qualities. It really captures a scene too! Easy to use for a great video.The cons, bring a portable charging pack. The charging case isn't suffice. 30 seconds really drains this thing! I have to cycle a long time to get the 30 seconds back, even if I fully charged it. Next the wide angle isn't superb. It is great! Don't get me wrong, but it will degrade in quality, or not capture everything. (I am cycling so that may be specific to my use of it) I have scenery in my video where it was outstanding, however I was also passing geese that were crossing the road and you can't even notice them at all. Using the wide angle.Not a pro, or con: The saturation is definitely an instagram trade mark and for the most part I like it. Except when it changes the tone of the true scenery. Again it's mixed because a cloudy day can look sunny which is great. However your hills might look desert middle eastern next to this random pile of snow. This stuff can be edited too though, so nothing too major.
