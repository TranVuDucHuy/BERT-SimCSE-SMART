This affordable set of LED lights is exactly what I needed to complete a photoshoot I was doing in my living room with a green screen. While 3 ended up not being enough to light properly, they did a great job lighting the backdrop. I imagine there are brighter versions out there for more money, but I was happy with these and I had some other lights that I was able to use to make the photoshoot work.I love that they do not get hot as I needed to lay one down (see in the picture under the ladder) without any worry of melting the foam pads I had in place.I will keep my eyes open for another lightning deal on these as I think a 2nd set will make almost any shoot possible.The only cons I have are that you have to remember to have a USB plug adapter on hand for each one if you don't have a USB power source. While most people probably have 1 or 2, ensuring 3 are available may be hard. The wires were also not that long, so when the lights are fully extended, I needed extension cords. All minor if planned properly.Overall, I'm very happy for the price I paid.
