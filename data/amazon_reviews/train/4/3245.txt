Two things that would make it better are lights from the side, & a longer power cord. However, the lights can be DIY'd. It does cast a little shadow, I adjusted the light and shadow with my phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra) in the pictures you see here. The left is with the textured backgrounds they send. It's ok but not what I wanted. Bought a piece of flexible poster board from the dollar 25 tree, cut to size, I like the crisp background much better (photo on right). The poster board can then be stored flat in the carry bag it comes in to avoid bending. It's easy to assemble, no instructions needed. It's very portable so the short cord issue can be remedied by plugging into a portable battery pack via USB. The size is small so read the description! I need it for small things so it works for me. Overall a great buy, I dont mind sprucing it up with the DIYs I mentioned because of the portability & ease to assemble & store. All the DIY light boxes online mention cardboard boxes and I don't need a large box to be taking up room 24/7 when I can just pull out this nifty tool. 4/5 stars because it could have been easy for them to add side lights, but they chose not to. That's the DIY part that will now cost me extra.
