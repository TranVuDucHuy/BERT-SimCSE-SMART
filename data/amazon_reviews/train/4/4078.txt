The Jlab Go earbuds are an alright alernative to the apple airpods. If you just needed some earbuds to actually use for everyday ease, then I would 100% recomend these. A few issues that I ran into, though:- Slips out of ears easilyDon't know if anyone else has been experiencing this, but they do slip out pretty easily after a while of use. Doesn't take too long to fix, just a simple wipe with tissue/cloth and you're good to go.- Sound is not that goodNot a super terrible sound, but on the base sound configuration setting, it's a bit quiet. If you like that, then it's perfeclty fine, however.A decently nice alternative, if you're looking for something cheep and quick, I'd reccomend these.
