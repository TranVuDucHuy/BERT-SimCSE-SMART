Sound is actually really clear, volume fantastic. Bluetooth connection easy to set up, and I never had a dropped bluetooth connection.Only complaint I have is battery life is shorter than the "up to 15" hours that is advertised. At max volume, it feels like it's 1 hour per 10%. It will last a whole day (8 hours) if that's what your life is, but it's shorter than the "up to 15 hours" that is advertised. Having said that, i usually recharge around 30% because I don't want to risk running it down and having it die in the middle of a call. Maybe at max volume this battery life is reasonable.I contacted their customer service to ask for clarity on what the expected battery life should be, and we corresponded via several emails which got me no where (can you download Jabra Direct? What firmware are you on? How are you connecting to the machine? Did the light turn on when you charge?). Their customer service people didnt seem to have good training, but maybe I'm just too hard on them.I do think it's a good product worth the money (~$80) but just note the two points I made and make your own decision. Good luck.
