Pros:Easy to charge it up and the battery last a long timeNever have to worry about getting it wet, but a lens cap is still a good ideashoots quickly - no lag between button and shutterCons:In bright sunlight it is almost impossible to see the screen to frame and focus.Not much of a telephoto, nor much of a wideangleI found the HDR was poor - really flattened out the colorsOptions were easy to select - but often required going through a menu to set them up, which slows you downThe video mode does not tell you clearly when it is shooting and when it is stoppedI bought this for a trip to Iceland - and it was great to have a waterproof camera given that it rained almost the whole trip.But looking at the results, my pictures taken with my Iphone XR are consistently better. This camera often took pictures with way too much contrast. Nor could it take slow motion video like my Iphone.
