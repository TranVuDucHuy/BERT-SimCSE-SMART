Update: I decided to keep them. They are inexpensive and do work well for their intended purpose. I still hate the multifunction touch sensors, but have been able to get them to respond - sometimes. I will just use my phone to pause/skip/control volume/manage calls. The volume is still too low, but was able to tweak a little more volume from my iPhone by picking a different EQ setting (Late Night) in the Music app in Settings, and also by going to Sounds in Settings and maxing out the volume limit on Headphone Safety. Otherwise, as I wrote below, they are high quality, very small and light, and pair well. I did go ahead and also purchase a different pair with earhooks, so they won't ever fall out, and also provide more volume, but are more expensive and have a bulkier case.Pros:The sound reproduction is really excellent, and accurate.The pairing is flawless.The buds are magnetized into the case, and the lid also seems to be kept closed magnetically.Light and comfortable.Cons:Multifunction touch control is very nearly useless, or was for me. Not a deal breaker because I would not use it for calls, and can control volume and tracks from my phone, but it was incredibly frustrating to have it work only half the time.Although the tonal balance is excellent, with a rich sound, the volume is abysmal - and yes, I had it turned up all the way both on the device and my phone. My ears were checked earlier this year and there is no loss, so I am surprised there are few comments about this. In a gym they are useless, but even in bed they were not loud enough, and much less volume than my two pairs that are seven years old. So I am returning.
