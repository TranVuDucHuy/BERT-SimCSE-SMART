This is my third 360 camera and follows the original Insta360 camera and a Go Pro 360 camera. The One Inch RS camera affords much higher video quality due to its 6K resolution and one inch image sensor than either of my two previous 360 cameras. Image quality is very good to excellent and is especially good in low light situations. The modular design of the camera is nice, but not easy to disassemble and reassemble. (After my first effort at disassembling and reassembling the One Inch, the camera failed to work and I had to repeat the process being very careful to correctly connect the components.) The position of the power button is less obvious and not as accessible as I would like. The door covering the USB C charging port is not easily opened and tends to flop down making insertion of the USB C cable occasionally awkward. Insta360 have done a very good job with the software (Insta360 Studio 2022) and this is a huge advantage to their 360 cameras. Reframing 360 videos is easy and straightforward using their software. I do regret that the software does not afford a feature that allows you to save a project and come back to it later. Once the program is closed all edits are lost. This seems a remarkably missing feature. Kudos to Insta360 Tech Support. I had a problem with the One Inch on Christmas Eve, and wrote them. On Christmas morning I had a detailed and helpful response. In summary, I am very pleased with the Insta360 RS One Inch camera, feel that it currently is the image quality champion in consumer 360 cameras, and is worth the higher price to achieve this image quality.
