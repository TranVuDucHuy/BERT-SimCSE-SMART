The camera has great quality. The setup was quick and easy. The reasons I chose this were the dual band, the affordability and that I did not have to pay monthly fee for playback. All of these did not disappoint and my WiFi connection works well in the garage. However, the app makes me crazy. The slider in the playback is so finicky, it’s hard zero in on an exact frame. Additionally, the scheduling option for motion detection also has a tricky slider, and I still haven’t been able to figure out how to set it. Since the camera ONLY comes with the setup instructions, it would be helpful to have some assistance with the scheduling in the app. I searched the site for instructions, but my screen does not have the steps to take like the article indicates. I’ve checked the version and tried sliding that stupid slider to select exact times, but to no avail. I guess I will have to contact support, because if I can’t get it to work, the camera is going back.
