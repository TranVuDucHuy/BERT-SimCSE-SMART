Â Neat mini speaker. I connected it to my TV and it connected pretty quickly. The volume is decent, wish it could be louder. When connected to my phone, it's super loud. Not sure why the TV is different.Nonetheless, it's easy to use, the bass is amazing on this little thing and the battery life is good. I have an android phone and it doesn't pickup the actual quality of the sound and volume in the video i uploaded however, it's pretty good. This phone just sucks. It can be played while charging. Haven't tried the radio yet but eventually I will
