I got these initially to hear people better on the Teams calls when I have background noise in my office - the office printer is right behind me and people walking by talking. It also was so others on the call could not hear my background noise either. This past week I have been using them at home as my bathroom is being completely remodeled. The noise has been so loud, with a complete demolition, saws cutting tiles, shop vac running, all about 10 - 15 feet away from me and no one on my calls can hear a thing. I have been so impressed by this. It is true that you cannot walk too far away from the base before it impedes other people's ability to hear you talking, but you can still hear them. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend them.
