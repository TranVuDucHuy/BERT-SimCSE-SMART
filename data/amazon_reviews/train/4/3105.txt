We will be using these as a backdrop for our wedding ceremony as well as Photo Booth. The option to vary height and width is nice! The curtains pictures here are velvet and quite heavy- no bowing on the frame! Super easy to put up and take down- didnâ€™t even have to use instructions. Extra clips and light weight bag to carry it all in!
