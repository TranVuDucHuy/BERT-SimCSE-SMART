SO FAR THIS HAS WORKED REALLY WELL WITH USING AN IPHONE. THE STAND HOLD THE PHONE TIGHTLY AND HAS HELD IT WELL. THE DISTANCE THAT THE STAND GOES UP AND DOWN IS SUFFICIENT FOR AMATURE PICTURE TAKING. THE BLUETOOTH REMOTE WORKS REALLY WELL, I HAVE HAD NO ISSUES SO FAR AND IT WAS SUPER EASY TO PAIR WITH THE IPHONE. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IT THE STAND IS A BIT WOBBLY IN GRASS OR DIRT PATHS/ROADS. I HAVE HAD TO SHIM IT WITH A PIECE OF WOOD OR A ROCK TO GET IT LEVEL BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT HAS WORKED GREAT. ( NO ISSUE WITH STAND WHILE INDOORS ON CARPET OR TILE FLOORS).
