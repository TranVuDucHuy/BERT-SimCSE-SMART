I bought these charging cords with the multi-tips and self-winding design to avoid the tangle in my car pocket. It was good that the various types of tips were available for passengers that have a diff type of phone than I do, as well. So far, they charge well and have re-rolled up very nicely! The second cord I took to work and it has performed well, too. The only reason I gave the durability a 4-star rating is that it took me a bit to learn how to roll them up on the core in a flat, stable manner. Once I got the trick of it, all seems well.
