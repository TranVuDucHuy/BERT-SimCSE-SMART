Â Pros:- Best menu system on the market. Easy to navigate and clear.- Outstanding picture quality for the money.- Advanced features that you normally don't see on cameras twice the price.> Raw recording> XLR audio input> Focus assist, false color, zebra stripes, etc. these you don't often find on a camera at this price.- Easily configurable quick action buttons.- Good support for bluetooth phone apps.- Record directly to a low cost SSD drive.- Comes with a free copy of Davinci Resolve Studio.Cons:- No auto-focus- Batteries are consumed like nothing I've ever seen. If you plan to use this away from a power outlet, make sure you're using a very large alternative battery. Or else you'll be swapping out the little batteries every half-hour.- The power cord is awkward to connect to the camera. Requires nimble fingers and is easy to get backwards. Like the old USB days but much worse. Also the power cord is too short for any practical use.- The on-board microphones seem to be high quality but their gain is so low that you can't end up with good quality after boosting it. Don't rely on the microphone (who would, anyway).- Micro four-thirds lenses are less common, so most people will need to buy new lenses or buy an expensive adapter to use other lenses. So far I've been impressed with Meke cinema lenses.Expect to spend another thousand dollars to rig this up properly. But if you're in the market for a cinema camera, this still ends up saving you thousands compared to a more convenient alternative. And that's just it. You're basically trading convenience for cost savings.Know what you're getting into, and this may be the perfect camera for you. Or a terrible choice. Depends.
