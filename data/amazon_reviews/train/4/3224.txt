Overall this is a great beginner telescope. The fact that it comes with it's own backpack is a plus. It was super easy to assemble and I was able to view the full moon beautifully. The software is terrific and easy to use.My complaints are:The tripod is NOT stable and far too short to be useful (I'm 5' 7"). I nearly turned myself into a pretzel trying to use the scope and then look into the eyepiece. I wound up grabbing a camp chair and sitting so that I didn't throw my back out We're looking in to getting another one.The camera attachment is not very easy to use. You have to take your phone out of its case, but no matter how light, it pulls the telescope out of angle and you have to start over again from scratch. I actually held my camera to the eyepiece to get a pictureBecause of this, I gave this 4 stars
