I haven't had alot of experience with these type of cameras, but i remember a friend of mine going above and beyond just to get a decent quality picture from a different model, this one is easy to use and does the job great without that much of an effort, i took one star out because when i finally gave it to my gf , we turned it on and tried to take a picture, the light was blinking as if there was an error, after half an hour of trouble shooting turns out that the batteries included were of very bad quality! As soon as i switched the batteries, it worked fine.It's weird that they'll include batteries that cannot even power rhe thing properly.
