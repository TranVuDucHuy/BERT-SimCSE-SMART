It's a good little HD camcorder for the price. As some other reviews noted, I ordered the 1080p version but I received the 2.7K version. Can't complain about getting an upgrade at the same price. I suspect the factory must be in the process of phasing out the older models, but they're continuing to use the old shells to house the new electronics. It looks exactly like the 1080p camera in the photos of the product listing. I'm only a little disappointed that I ordered it to use as a webcam, but though you technically can do that, it's not convenient or practical to use it as a webcam. It can't be charged while in webcam mode, so you're limited to battery power until the battery runs out of juice. Also, the flip out screen can't be closed without it shutting off the camera, so even if you choose to use it in webcam mode running on battery power, you must leave the screen in the open position. It's still a good camera. I'll be keeping it to use as a regular camcorder, but I would have liked to have been able to use it for what I ordered it for, as a webcam.
