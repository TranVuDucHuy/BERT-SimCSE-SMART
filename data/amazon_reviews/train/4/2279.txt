Bought a blu g90 pro cell phone. The purchase was made as fast as possible since my current phone stopped taking a charge via usb3.I have no landline or laptop anymore.A few offered to suggest full reboot kind of worthless suggestions my last few momrnts were almost gone, and no phone no 911 or Vet for my almost 18year old dog is coming close.Had a few moments left before my old phone became power dead an unchargeable.Ended up SHOCKINGLY SURPRISED how fast the blu g90 pro was and non of the unbearable glitches of my TCL 10L (my first known brand & expensive for me phone, and was terrible and died in such a short time.MY NEW CURRENT WORKING SO WELL BLU G90 PRO I WAS SURE I THOUGHT IT SAID IT HAD WIRELESS CHARGING.I ASKED ON THE Q&A SECTION FOR THE PHONE WITH ANSWERS FROM BOTH ENDS OF SPECTRUM RROM ANGRY "NO! ARE YOU STUPID" TO "IT SAYS ON THE PAGE IT DOES, TO MY NEW BEST FRIEND WHO SAID HE TRIEDANANKOR WIRELESS CHARGER & NOT KNOWING MUCH, HE PLUGGED a full sized USB POWER PLUG into power strip and MICRO (not mini & not usb3) into the tiny charging hole on side of the black disk.That was IT. No software or app the phone did have wireless charging but the company didn't make and chargers.This ANKOR Brand worked as a generic fully compatible .... LOW PRICE AND ON SALE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT FOR $12 W FREE PRIME SHIPPING.AMAZING.NOT FIVE STARS YET. NEED TO MAKE SURE IT HAS GOOD CHARGE, DOESNT GET HOT AND BURN OUT OR MAKE THE PHONE CATCH FIRE BEFOEE 5 STARS.PRETTY SUEE OK,BUT STILL, THE SOLID BLACK CHARGING DISK NEEDS A BIT OF EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE OF THE PHONE IN WITHIN THE CHARGING AREA, AND NO LINES, MARKERS OR ANY REMINDER INDICATION OF GENERAL CHARGING AREA TO PUT PHONE ON.ALSO, IN ADDTION TO LOSING SIGHT FASTER THAN BELIEVABLE AFTER TURNING 50 YRS OLD.YESTERDAY I WAS SURE IT DIED AFTER A DAY OR TWO.BUT IN DIM LIGHT WHILE WATCHING LIGHT, THE TWO SIDES OF THE BLACK CHARGING DISK SEEM IDENTICAL AND WAS PUTTING IT ON THE NON CHARGING SIDE WITHOUT REALIZING IT.THEILLED GOT IT RIGHT WITH AN UNDER 60 SEC SEARCH, CHECK & BUY.THRILLED I LOOKED AT A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS, AND THE ONLY PERSON NAMING THIS ANKOR BRAND WIRELESS CHARGER FOR THE EXACT BRAND AND MODEL BRAND OF NEW CELL PHONE.DON'T KNOW HOW MANY BRANDS IT WORKS WITH, BUT FIRST STEP IS TO CHECK IF YOUR PHONE DEFINITELY WAS MADE TO ACCEPT WIRELESS CHARGING.IT IS NOT USUALLY CLEAR, ESPECIALLY ON A LOW END PHONE. PRIOR, ONLY NEW APPLE OR SAMSUNG AT OVER $1,200 Actually had wireless charging.Happy with phone and even more the generic brand wireless charger works
