I had some trouble getting the foam cut exactly how I wanted. It kind of tears easily. However, I got it to be good enough. Basically I was making an emergency kit with a flashlight, batteries, and a USB backup charger that takes batteries.The case feels pretty flimsy but I just stored it away. I may take it camping in the future, but for now it's just an emergency power/flashlight kit, so it doesn't get messed with often. For the price, it's awesome, but if you want to store something really pricey in a foam case, I'd recommend going with a nice, name brand case. I cannot vouch for the long-term stability of the foam, since some foam types do break down.
