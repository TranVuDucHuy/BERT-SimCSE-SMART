I dont want to be dishonest in any way but I really do enjoy my headphones, my ONLY complaint is that whenever I take a call I'm hard to hear. So the mic isn't the best on this thing. I think it might be a hit or miss, because a friend of mine also bought these and hers work perfectly. Good luck on your purchase, I still enjoy mine, perfect for the gym!
