After several decades, I wanted to return to observing the night sky through telescopes. I didn't want to begin with an expensive telescope, so I went with a entry level item. Celestron is one of the most popular telescope makers in the world, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with a telescope from them, which is why I went with the Celestron 70mm Travel Scope DX.I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the diagonal, spotting scope, and tripod. After reading some of the reviews though, I was prepared for that. I ordered a replacement diagonal and tripod along with the telescope. I was more concerned with the quality of the scope. I was pleased with the scope itself.The best way to get started is by observing the easier objects. It allows a person to get used to searching the sky, finding the object you're looking for, and enjoying the view. What better subject to begin with than the moon.The above pictures are of the telescope where I was taking terrestrial photos using a SVBONY SV105 camera. The next was the first picture of the moon with the telescope with my Google Pixel and the smart phone adapter that came with the telescope. As you can see, it needs a lunar filter. Thankfully the telescope came with one. The third image is one taken of the moon with the same Google Pixel phone. This one I still didn't use the filter for, because the Google Pixel has the ability to adjust for the brightness of the moon. I just used my phone's photo ability. The final photo is of trees in the distance taken using the 70mm Travel Scope and the SVBONY SV105 camera.
