Picked 3 different models for a non photography project.This one is not as robustly built as the other models but is very bright. Battery on high is no where near the published time frame.The defuser is quite functional however its can be a chore to put on and offIt is important to note. I had to use these for an instrument that requires about 6500 Kelvin light to operate. I placed them near the device to allow the light to shine over the shadow sensors... the display faded put on my device, after playing around with batteries and position I found that these emit some interference which could cause issues with other devices. I have not tried them with any photography or computer equipment other than my one device for measuring velocity.
