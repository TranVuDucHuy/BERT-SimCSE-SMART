I bought this to use for a newborn (12 days) session. The ring is much larger than I expected. The pillows were exactly the size I expected but that ring is BIG. It was an easy fix with a couple of rolled up hand towels but still a little annoying having to improvise. It’ll be perfect for babies, I’d say, starting around 6-8 weeks. Any younger and you’ll just have to get creative! Overall it’s great and I’ll definitely continue to use it for babies of all ages but I do suggest either downsize the ring or make the pillows a little bigger.
