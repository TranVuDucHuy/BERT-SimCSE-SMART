I had one that I had bought about a year ago and thought that I would buy another and pair them together for the pool area. What I didn't know is that my speaker was a different "version" from the one that I just purchased. After unsuccessfully trying to pair the old one with the new one, I finally talked to the manufacturer and they said that the two had to be the same version. The version is not on the speaker itself, it is determined only by the logo and insignia placement on the bottom of the speaker. No way of finding it otherwise - either for the old speaker or the new speaker. No where in the description does it give the version number. This made the two speakers that I now owned totally useless for what I had intended. When I returned to purchase another one of the new speakers, it was no longer on sale, however, it did go back on sale within a few days (during the holidays) and I had to buy a third speaker to get them to do what I wanted the two to do, which was to pair in stereo mode with left and right channels. Fortunately the second new speaker was the same version as the first new speaker that I had purchased a few weeks later, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING THE VERSION UNTIL I RECEIVED IT AND TRIED TO PAIR THEM!!!! COME ON OONTZ! Help us out here and give the version guide in the description! I now own three of these and one is useless for what I want to do.
