Im a first time camera buyer. After perusing reviews on CNET, etc, I looked up this camera on Amazon. I am pretty impressed. The video quality is very good...less so in low light, but still clear enough to make out details. the AI mentioned refers to facial recognition, and its a feature I dont use, but its impressive that its there at this price level.The camera comes with a charger (no batt option) that has a very generous cable length, and must be plugged in full time. You can watch live or record to the cloud. If you insert a microSD card, you can record without paying for storage. Nice options.At first I thought I could only view when within range of my WIFI, but I was surprised to find that I can view remotely as well!This would be great as a baby monitor bcs it has 2 way sound as well (slightly muddled).We use it to keep tabs on our coprophagic puppy. She is all too happy to create her own snacks, and we can see her behavior and intervene before...ya know. So for us its a training tool. Buy this thing and come up with a solution!Only one con; video has about 1.5 second delay.
