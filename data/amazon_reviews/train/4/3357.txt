A good purchase - this has been a great investment for my business.the device did not come with a manual - so had to stumble my way around - at the time, the user videos were not yet loaded on amazon.also, I record outside of the app - because when you hit record - it DOES NOT ever stop recording. You can pause the record, but it never stops - I have to end up force closing the app - and then lose video.So my safest bet is always to record outside of the app.apart from that - its sturdy, and stable.
