It does what it should. I have only been using it for about a week now so I can't comment on it's durability, I can say it works.I got what I needed, it's unidirectional and and not active. When I bought it I wasn't really sure what I needed. Unfamiliar with display port applications, it was confusing.It's working fine now, so I got what I paid for.
