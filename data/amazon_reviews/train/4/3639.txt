These headphones are amazing; the sound quality is nice, and the noise cancellation is satisfactory. The fit is a bit on the tighter side for an adult head but once you wear it regularly for a while then it loosens a bit and everything's fine; I wear these headphones for hours at a time with no problems, even with glasses! The way it folds is very convenient as well, and the headset itself is very durable. My only gripe is that the wire connection to the left ear is weaker than other headphones I've used in the past; 2 and a half months of regular use for me and something in the wiring's gone weird and the little button that controls the music is misfiring! But aside from that defect I can't recommend this pair enough if you need a cheaper set of over-ear headphones in a pinch!
