Works pretty good for the price. Was a little to get to work due to the copyright stuff but we finally figured it out. Mirroring i think they call itI did need to order a piece to hook up to the tv for that also but i knew that and ordered along with it. The focus is not perfect but its watchable. The screen is just ok. If it's not on a solid color wall and real flat it makes harder to see.
