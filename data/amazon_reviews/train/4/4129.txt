I don’t like how tipsy this can be unless one of the legs is facing the same direction as the boom when extended with a mic. I used a Shure PGA-58 and a Pyle wireless mic in this, and it wanted to tip over unless one of the legs was the same direction as the boom. Also, the carry case is VERY flimsy. The strap broke on mine day one as I was carrying it. Okay, now that the big negatives are out of the way, this is a great stand for the fact that it is lightweight and VERY portable. When you‘re trying to travel light, this is the mic stand for you. It is MUCH easier to lug around with your gear and inexpensive if someone steals it or it gets lost.
