I'd recommend this if you aren't too rough with your phone. It cracks more easily than the much stronger ones I've had before, but it still protected my phone from damage, and for the low price you can just replace it with the second one in the pack. I only buy these now and replace them periodically rather than spending more on the higher-quality ones because they all crack eventually.
