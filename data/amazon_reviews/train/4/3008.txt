It is a nice earpiece. Has multiple ear inserts depending on your ear size and preference. The buttons are really easy to reach while wearing the earpiece. The only thing that was a little annoying was the mute alert. While having it muted it states muted over the earpiece quite frequently. It is loud enough to cover up your conversation. Other than that is charged quickly and comes with a nice storage case the only the earpiece and not the small charging cord. Good luck not losing it. I keep the case and cord in the nice small box it came shipped in
