These are great for the price. I wish they had a wireless remote. The colors are great for making the light look more natural. I wish they had a better diffuser slide. USB powered is good and bad at the same time. Fairly sturdy. I have knocked tuem over many times and they have held up with no issues. They are very bright and have dimming ability.
