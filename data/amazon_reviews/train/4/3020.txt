I actually hit the “return this item” button because I was very disappointed to find out that this doo-da doesn’t hook up to your wireless Bluetooth headphones?!What the point of having Bluetooth in it then?I suppose it will work maybe if you synch the thing with your phone and then your headphones with your phone and play on GarageBand- but I haven’t tried that and really can’t be arsed. I just want to practice.So look, don’t expect this to work with your AirPods - that is a massive fail and 1 star off.I haven’t really got to playing around with this too much, only 2 days in, but it’s good enough for me to decide I want to keep it and even purchase the mustang gtx 100 amplifier now because the sounds are so good. A little constrained by being unable to modify the sound much. The distortion comes from amp choice rather than effect which is weird, the effects are good but again only a few appeal to me - everyone has their style. I’m not going to use the death metal setting just as Jimmy WhiteSnake isn’t going to use the more finesse sounds.Overall it seems totally boss and has made lunch time at work a whole new experience as I can shut the world out and practice songs with a much better understanding of how I’m playing by being plugged in.A wee bit expensive - yes, there are other options out there but they don’t seem to have the variety or backing that Fender are giving here.Ok, I’m done, back to playing. Take it away.
