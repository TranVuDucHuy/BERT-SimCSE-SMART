The battery life is actually amazing! In the 4 months I’ve used these headphones, they actually last a long time since I use them to help me sleep at night. I can play them for 8hrs each night and still have a tiny bit of battery left for the third haha. The noise cancellation is really good especially when you are playing music or video through the bluetooth. My only problem is that for the last month or so the bluetooth hasn’t been working that well? It keeps saying “Bluetooth disconnected. Bluetooth disconnected. Bluetooth reconnected.” every 5 minutes or so which is annoying to hear in the middle of watching videos or listening to music, but that problem has only showed up recently so it could just be a personal headphone experience. Overall, the headphones are easy to connect and use and I really like using them!!
