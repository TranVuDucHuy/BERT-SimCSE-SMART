These lights could use some improvements, but it's great for the price. These took about 10 minutes to setup. The lights look great in color #2-4 (although the yellow isnt too vibrant #3 & the lowest setting is not as bright as I expected #5) I also enjoyed mixing colors #6-7. I wish the stands were built a little better, but maybe they'll function better w/ sandbags. I didnt mind plugging the usb cords into boxes I already had, but after plugging one onto an outlet, one into a computer port and one into a portable power bank, I noticed the power bank charge made the on/off switch heat up! Just something to think about when setting them up for shoots. Overall, it'll get the job done.Pros:-lightweight / easy setup-no bulbs / minimal blowouts-beautiful colorsCons:-stands aren't very strong-stand is only about 3'8-4 ft tall-no outlet boxes included
