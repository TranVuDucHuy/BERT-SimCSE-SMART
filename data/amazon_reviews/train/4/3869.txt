If you're looking for a basic camera to be able to keep tabs on any particular room of the house these are great. The quality of the picture is decent, though it depends on the quality of your wifi signal strength. I have a few cameras that are a little choppy or delayed because they are farther from my modem. I use an SD card rather than pay for a monthly cloud subscription and so far that's been good enough for me. I like that it has sound and that I can turn it off when not needed. I also like that it has as a two way communication speaker so I can talk to who's ever in the room. I haven't had these long enough to give a full review on video storage and playback with an SD card but so far so good.
