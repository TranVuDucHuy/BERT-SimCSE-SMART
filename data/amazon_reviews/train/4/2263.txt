Great product, definitely a step up from my Bose wireless.The battery life lasts about 5-6 hours of use at work, the sound quality and fit is great. I love the EQ adjustments and quick touches.I will say that they can sometimes be annoying to accept calls with and if you scratch your ear on a call or teams meeting you may hang up.The biggest thing is periodically there is a glitch cut out noise. Have troubleshot and submitted to Sennheiser but still no resolution.I love the quality of music so Iâ€™ll keep using and bear through the nuisance.
