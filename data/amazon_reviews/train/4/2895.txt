Fantastic sound quality, shockingly much better than my JBL Clip 3, just not as compact--which has its perfect uses that this speaker is a little too large for. That said, I am pretty thrilled with much about this speaker! It is about the size of a smallish 'ghetto blaster'--pic with 12 oz water bottle for scale.. Sound quality fantastic, higher volume range, great sound depth and definition, portability, and a really great price. The rubberized waterproofing also serves as a shock absorber of sorts, and I tend not to vibrate this one off of the surfaces it sits on as badly as others I have had. I have not tried the waterproof and floating capabilities yet but feel confident taking it to my gardening job, on our many outdoor adventures, or to the lake. Perfect for use in my truck, too--poor radio reception here, so you have to provide for yourself if you want sound. Despite a couple of issues, I am quite pleased with this speaker.The issues I have with it: 1) operating the volume control from my Samsung phone does not always work or is often very slow to respond and that is very irritating; 2) I rarely get 30 hours out of the battery; I need to charge it daily, but that is not a deal breaker. I use it most of the day, often 3-4 a.m. until 9-10 p.m., so I really cannot complain, and time my charging to accommodate that. Sustained higher volume play runs it down faster, again not a huge problem if I keep my wits about me and charge it every night.I take my dog and my music everywhere. Glad to have this great little speaker along for the ride.
