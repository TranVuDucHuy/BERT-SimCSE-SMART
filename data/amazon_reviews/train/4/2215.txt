I like this mic, the only thing it's missing for me to rate it a 5 is a mute button.I record hypnotherapy sessions and this is great, I love this, just wish it had a mute button.It's already put together and super easy to use and store away. The sound is GREAT! If you're using Audacity, you can pause it and use that as the 'mute' and then pick up right where you left off without a break in the recording. Good price.
