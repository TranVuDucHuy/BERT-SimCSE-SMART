This works really well most of the time, but sometimes loses its grip on the inside of our windshield. The thing I don't like is that the suction cup is in the GoPro's line of sight when we have it on the truck windshield, and we haven't been able to figure out any way to position the camera on the windshield while using it which keeps that from happening. It took us a while to figure out what it was that was in all the pictures we took. Other than that, the video is unbelievably stable, even when taken on washboard dirt roads.Thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.
