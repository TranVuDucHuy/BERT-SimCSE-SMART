As others have mentioned, this camera will rapidly consume batteries. Just be sure to buy some rechargeable AA batteries to use with this camera (or find a very good deal on a bulk supply of alkaline cells). Otherwise, the optical quality of this camera is excellent for a point-and-shoot camera in its price range. Color rendition, optical (and digital) zoom, manual settings variety, and ease of use are all great. The battery issue is actually a plus for those searching for a good camera deal, as a small deficiency of that type will make the camera less popular with the typical user, and it will therefore be priced lower to sell off quickly.You should be able to find a great discount on new or "open box" used cameras. Mine was purchased "used, like new" and it didn't have a scratch on it.You will need to study and try out the various manual "scene" settings to get exactly the results you desire. If you make the proper setting selections, you'll create images of much higher quality than any phone camera.So, three points :1. Buy rechargeable AA batteries for this camera, or buy bulk generic alkaline packs. No Duracell etc. as they last somewhat longer, but are not justified by the much higher price.2. Stay alert for discounted units.3. Test out the many image options to acquaint yourself with the camera's capabilities for the best results. The beginning user may be disappointed with the picture quality, but only because they've chosen the wrong setting.
