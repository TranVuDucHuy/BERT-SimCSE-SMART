I purchased this frame for my family member who has early dementia. She really likes it. I appreciate how easy it was for me to load the memory card. Photos automatically rotate and adjust for proper viewing whether they are horizontally or vertically taken by the photographer. There is an ability to pause, fast forward or rewind one photo at a time (button on back). If youâ€™re looking for an inexpensive, easy to operate digital photo frame? I would suggest this one.
