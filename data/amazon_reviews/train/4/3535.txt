I tried the competition and this has the best fit for my ears,seals pretty well and it won't fall out even after an hour of sweaty Muay Thai workout.Sound is only OK...you can enhance it in the app a bit but it's nowhere near close to Beats,Bose or Sony,bass is not as deep but you can still enjoy your music while you move aroundAlso,there is a problem with not able to play sounds if you switch the apps(from music player to Social media or Youtube),you need to re-connect them every time you switch the app which can be annoying if you are multitasking between the apps a lot...These are light,rugged and utilitarian headphones designed to get you through the workout and stay put and they do that so well!
