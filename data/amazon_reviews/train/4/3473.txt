This charger is simple but it works great. Just rest your qi-charging compatible phone (I have an iPhone 11) on the dock and it starts charging in minutes. Mine worked just fine despite having a plastic protective cover.I got this after my phone's charging port stopped functioning reliably. Fortunately, qi charging makes it easy to just set this down and charge up. I'm also getting a pair for my parents to save them having to deal with cables. I also like the fact that it rests at an angle so if you can easily charge while still using the phone without having to hold it up.Unfortunately, it's shape also leads to this charger's major drawback. The unit is one rigid design of molded plastic, so it's not very convenient for travel. I wish it could fold or collapse flat, which would make it much easier to transport in a work or travel bag. If you're looking for one that travels well, a smaller, flat design is probably a better choice.Still, for convenience and ease of use at home, this charger worked well for me.
