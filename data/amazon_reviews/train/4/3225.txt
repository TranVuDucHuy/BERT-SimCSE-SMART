The telescope is great. Super light and easy to use.I upgraded the spotting scope to one with the laser. The tripod is lightweight but not very sturdy. When I try to lock position in place it always moves because the telescope is a bit too heavy for it. So I’m likely going to upgrade to a better tripod.The iPhone mount attachement is also useless because it’s heavier than the scope. So again locking an image into place after finding it in the focusing scope is impossible.So some updates are needed to use the telescope. But it’s a great one for beginnners. I tried another Celestron a bit more advanced. It made finding and focusing much much easier and smoother. But the item was bulky and heavy.So I prefer this one just for its compactness and ease of use. Price evens out to the other more expensive one after the add ons.
