I bought this to use with my small business for making videos and taking pictures of products and I think it works awesome! The only downside is the stand is hard to get out of the frame but it doesn't bother me enough to outweigh my happiness with the product. I just swivel the head around which throws the balance off at the base but if you use a heavy book and lay it on the base it is perfect. Again not a huge issue but that is why i took one star off. All in all I am so happy I bought this one!
