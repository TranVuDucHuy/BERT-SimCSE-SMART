Since I have two other working digital cameras, I had certain expectations for this camera. So far, it is working well. My other two digitals have chargers (that were misplaced when we moved residence), but the batteries for this one are easily accessible. So far I have taken one good picture that I am keeping for quite a while. The photo was quite clear, but my other cameras are faster, my dog is a swift subject to try to capture.
