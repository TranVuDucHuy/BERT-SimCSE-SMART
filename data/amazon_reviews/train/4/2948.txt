This "pen" opens a lot of features on the fold 4, but it isn't perfect.The good-more than just a stylus because just by using it, your phone will be able to do more things.The bad-i mostly bought this for the translate feature, but it doesn't work good. Bad translations, unrecognizes basic words, mostly works on phrases, doesn't really work on pics/mostly only text.-the tip is plastic, so it'll sometimes "skip" on the screen if you press it lightly.Most of the faults are on the phone's side, so i can't really blame the pen.
