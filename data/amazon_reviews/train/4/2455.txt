This is a great product but my biggest complaint is that you can't fast forward or "rewind" through saved footage. You must go to the specific point in time you wish to review and watch it in real time. It makes it so difficult to review footage since you can easily miss the time you need to verify unless you know the EXACT time. The motion sensor is extremely sensitive, too. A change in light coming through a curtain can be detected as "motion" so I found that feature to be less than useful to me.Otherwise, picture is clear even zoomed in, night vision is clear as day, and they are easy to install. Memory chips are a must if you don't want to pay the cloud subscription.
