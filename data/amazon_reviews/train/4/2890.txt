This is perfect for my needs. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is slim so I can access all the outlets.I have not used the USB outlets, and I do not expect to need them.Speaking practically, I am only able to use 8 of the outlets since the chargers are large and bulge out. The center outlets cannot be accessed.Great product for the price
