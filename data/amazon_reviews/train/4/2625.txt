A few minor complaints that don't super affect the overall usage. First off the color is a bit more blue so I have to set the key to remove a slightly more blue color but thats not a huge issue. It is a bit thin and very wrinkled, but without putting any dewrinkle effort in or blocking the back it's a non issue when I light it well. Feels like pretty decent material that should hold up with medium use. The price and size make all those things not matter much having easy fixes for any complaints I have. If you're looking to work with green screen on the cheap this is a great place to start.
