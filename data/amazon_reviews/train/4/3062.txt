I had to cut the lip on one corner off for it to fit and then install it upside down to be able to use the short cord it comes with. It works just fine mounted either way and the notch I had to cut on one corner for it to fit doesn't hurt the looks once it is mounted. It is still better than just having the Sync Module just hanging from the outlet. Still would recommend it and unless you are concerned about the warranty on the cameras there is not much need in the getting the Blink Plan's. Although if I were going to have more than 5 cameras I would most likely get the blink Plus plan as it covers an unlimited amount of cameras on a single account.
