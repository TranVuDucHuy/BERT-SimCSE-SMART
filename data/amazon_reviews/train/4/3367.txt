“Active Stylus Pen Compatible for iOS&Android Touch Screens…. “I have an Apple Pencil which works really well - unless you try to use it on an iPhone. Ridiculous.So I got one of these. I wanted it use on a coloring app. It seemed like it would be better than my finger. Turns out, they’re about the same and I’ll even give my finger slightly higher marks.What I found was that there were several ‘misfires’ where I had to keep tapping and changing angles to get the thing to work. I wondered if maybe I was using it wrong but there were no suggestions for use in the instructions. That was all about charging etc.It does have a good feel to it. Good weight. Good balance. I just wasn’t really impressed with performance. If I were making art like you see in commercials I would probably whip it.
