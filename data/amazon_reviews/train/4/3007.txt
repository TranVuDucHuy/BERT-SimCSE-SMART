I upgraded my router and my pc recently and felt like I might be leaving some performance on the table, I ordered this and was surprised to learn how accurate my estimate of 30 feet of length was, fits nearly perfectly in the distance between the router and pc. The only issue I had was that the connection header seems to be just a tiny bit bulkier than the one I replaced. This bill does not and any effect on the fit and functionality of the cable itself, but there was a hole I needed to make just a little bit bigger.If you are a gamer with a long distance to cover this category of cable is well worth the upgrade to, when I was using a 50 foot cat5e cable my average data speeds were about 300-350mbps with this being a higher grade of cable it obviously will preform better, after all the upgrades I did to my router and pc my average is now 400-500mbps, the cable and my equipment is not the bottleneck for this performance though, my internet service provider is. And I do not care much to pay more for faster internet speeds since this speed and bandwidth is already more than fast enough for everyone in the house to do their own thing.For the professional using this cable, as for the longevity of this product, I cannot attest to the rigors of frequent maintenance alterations to its position, I have more or less used this as a set it up and forget it cable to be managed away from people walking on it or.. well touching it in general. I may update this later if and/or when the cable fails.TLDR: for the average consumer this cable will not be your bottleneck for data speed, your internet connection and hardware will be.
