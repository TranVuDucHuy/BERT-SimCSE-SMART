I bought this to film youtube content and I was pretty disappointed. I ended up not being able to use any footage filmed with the microphone plugged in. It did not cancel out any background noise at all. It recorded voice well and very clearly, but any sort of background noise was very audible. If it wasn't for that the product would have been everything I hoped for, sadly now it just sits in a drawer.
