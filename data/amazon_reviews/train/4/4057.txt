I tried a Gosky 20-60x60 mm scope first and found it too dark and cheaply made (plastic barrel). The celestron 80mm scope was quite a bit nicer. Brighter, better made (aluminum barrel) and had a better (astronomical) eyepiece. However it is rather heavy for a light tripod and I found the thing very jittery. It works best under these conditions at relatively low power ( 20 to 30, say) but at 20 power a pair of larger binoculars will be brighter and more immersive. So I sent it back. If you have a really solid tripod it would be better but then you lose tha advantage of easy portability.
