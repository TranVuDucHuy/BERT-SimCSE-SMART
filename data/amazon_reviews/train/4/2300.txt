They are great BUDGET FRIENDLY over-the-ear headphones. Works as attended, sound quality is good but not great, you do get what you pay for remember that! The sound quality isnt the same as higher end $100+ headphones, BUT in its class ($50 or less) its really great! Noise canceling is a 7.5/10, sound quality is a 7/10, comfort 8.5/10, overal build quality 7/10.
