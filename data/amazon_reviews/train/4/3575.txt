I could make a ton of jokes about how this is "The Sexy Speaker," or make some other DankPods references. However, that's been done to death already, so I'll just say that this is a very decent speaker overall! The sound quality isn't anything that blows me away (it can be a bit bassy for some tastes), but it's more than good enough for my usual purposes, and the auxiliary option is great futureproofing.My only major gripes about this speaker are that there's a noticeable amount of latency when playing videos, and the fact that it charges using Micro USB instead of USB-C is somewhat disappointing in 2022.
