I bought this for conference calls for work (WFH). It comes with a USB dongle, which I'm using to connect to my laptop, but I can also connect to my phone via Bluetooth. As far as I can tell, Bluetooth pairing is not limited to one device.There's a switch ("ANC") on the right earpiece that controls the headset's active noise canceling. With that turned on, external low-frequency noise (fans, motors, traffic) is significantly reduced. Note: ANC only kicks in when you have the headset covering both ears. You'll hear an audible pop when it engages.The microphone is quite good. Highly directional. We've recently had a lot of construction going on, and the mic picks up my voice no problem, but not the construction noise. I could still hear a lot of it (hammering and circular saws aren't good candidates for ANC), but the people I was talking to online didn't notice the noise and could hear me just fine.The ear pieces are a bit warm, but reasonably comfortable, even after 2 hours on a call.The charging cradle is a bit fiddly, but workable.Default behavior has a voice prompt every time you go on or off mute. I eventually figured out how to turn that off using a downloadable utility from the manufacturer's website.Overall, though, this is a comfortable and decent-quality headset.
