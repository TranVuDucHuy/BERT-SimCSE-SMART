I got sick of my old ear buds, falling out of my ears when I try to work out, so I tried these to see if they would be better. Mostly, they have been very good. Apparently, my ear canals are some kind of unusual shape, because the right one still pops out on occasion, but I assume that’s just me. Other functionality, and all is very nice, especially for a relatively inexpensive set of earbuds. However, I noticed that these earbuds don’t get very loud. That’s probably a good thing for most people, because so many people turn them up too loud, and it’s never been a major issue, just occasionally when I really favorite song comes on and I can’t turn it up. Otherwise very good product.
