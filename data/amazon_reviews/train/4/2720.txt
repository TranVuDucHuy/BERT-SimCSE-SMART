I''m still getting used to Go Air Sport, but I have smallish ears and these are definitely comfortable to wear. Also love how long the battery lasts! I haven't used all of the button functions, but volume, pause & play work well. I don't feel like Go Air Sport has a very good "stereo" sound or noise cancellation compared to my previous set, although that one did have a connection wire. This is my first pair of true wireless and it's a real plus. The volume bar on my phone looks like it's playing very loud, but it truly is not.
