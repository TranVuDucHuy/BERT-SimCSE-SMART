This extension cord power strip surge protector combination unit is a must-have for the person who need power for “all the things” or is into crafting. With enough outlets and USB for convenience, this strip is bringing the power.The build is solid, as is its design. Stays cool to the touch and has enough room for most power supply box units. The flat cable is nice for under interior doors, and the length of extension is adequate for most US built homes that have outlets spaced according to the 12-foot rule.Highly recommended is this surge protector, in my opinion.
