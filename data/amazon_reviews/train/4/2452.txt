For the price, these cameras are extremely well-featured and effective. The audio and motion detection *might* be a little too sensitive... haven't really played around with those features.I'm using primarily using these for kennel cameras and passive security in tandem with my ADT system. Pets appreciate their Master's voice when left alone.My only reservation is that they are always on and it's easy to forget to turn off smart devices for privacy. I'm probably going to deploy these cameras on Govee Smart Outlets and group them so I can turn them on and off based upon my needs.Customer Service was very attentive to the issue I had with the first camera out of the box and shipped me out a replacement after cursory troubleshooting.
