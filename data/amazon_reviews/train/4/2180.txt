Easy to sleep in comfort-wise, (what i bought them for) does NOT cancel noise at all, seems to be made so you can hear around you, and is not meant to be a sleep mask, does not rest over eyes correctly meant for your head! I'd say they're strictly meant as an athletic headband. Audio quality is good enough for me but I'm not a critic on that, volume is Great, even though you can hear most of everything going on around you they do get pretty loud, so kinda cool if you need to be aware of your surroundings but still want to jam!
