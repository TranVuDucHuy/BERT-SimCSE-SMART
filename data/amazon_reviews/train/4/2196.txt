I’ve had a Brother printer for several years and just ordered all new ink cartridges. After installing them, I found that only the black cartridge was full. Of the colors, magenta had less than the other two. While they were close to full, that is not what users pay for. I contacted Brother customer service through chat and it took almost an entire hour to resolve the issue. The customer service agent tried to tell me the colors always show up as not completely full. I disputed his claim but he was ready to sign off. I requested an exchange which, after playing 20 questions, was finally granted. This is a quality control issue. If your cartridges are not showing as full when newly purchased, please contact Brother. If they get enough complaints, they’re more likely to check production.
