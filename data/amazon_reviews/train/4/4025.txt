All things considered, difficult to beat for the price and worked as expected. The only difficulties I had were that the filters had overlying plastic difficult to peel off, didn't receive the appropriate number/type of filters, and the LED quality was slightly underwhelming. The stands themselves feel sturdy and work as expected. The lights themselves feel slightly cheap, but seemed to work great. Intended use for video conferencing. Overall, very happy with this and would purchase again.I'd like to note that each item comes with a card asking for reviews, offering a gift card in return.
