You need to turn off your Bluetooth to disconnect when you put themBack in the case. I had apple ear pods beforeSo this is a little different. I like themSo far! I like that you can keep one in and leave the other in the case, there are buttons to use for skipping songs and talking to Siri. Certainly worth the low price.
