Easy to install, size and getting a Apple Watch on and off of wrist. Keeps watch snug for good health data. No fumbling with clasps or hooks of silicone bands. no hair snagging found with some metal bands. Have not used in hot weather yet, but wonder if perspiration will be an issue. Style is a bit simple, that can be good or not so much for some.
