I ordered this Sigma 18-50mm f2.8 and the Tamron 17-70mm f2.8 because I just could not decide which was better for me. The Sigma 18-50 was mostly great. It was small, light, and decently sharp. According to all the reviews the Sigma was supposed to be sharper than the Tamron, but that was not the case for me. At first I thought I just had a bad copy, and got a second 18-50. The second was better but the Tamron at 18 and 50mm was still sharper, and the Sigma doesn't go to 70mm. The Tamron also has slightly warmer colors, and I just kept picking out those photos over the Sigma. In the end I kept the Tamron. The Sigma is still a great little lens, but I preferred the Tamron 17-70.
