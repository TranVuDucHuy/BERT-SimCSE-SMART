Unit is not holding up very well. Surface of charging plate appears to be coming off see photo.Update:Belkin replaced my charger under warranty-appreciated!BTW: A different model is available for iPhone pro max models. This one works OK with my iPhone 14 promax but it was not really designed for such a heavy phone.
