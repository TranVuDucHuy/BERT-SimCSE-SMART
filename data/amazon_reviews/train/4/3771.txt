We have had several YI home cameras over the last 6 years. You get what you pay for. However if you are essentially using them as baby cameras they work great. One of our more recent cameras though never seemed to work well, it’s like it never wanted to truly connect or reset. Just keep that in mind. If the camera is having too many issues you might need to just return it. Usually they all (every type we have owned this far) work really well unless we have small children touching them haha. 4 stars overall because I’m sure there is better out there and they do have some connectivity issues and are not super resilient, but for approximately $40 they are a great buy and really help give you that extra pair of eyes.
