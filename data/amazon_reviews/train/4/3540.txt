Two fold review - the phone holder is GREAT!Very sturdy and robust (and has a lifetime warranty). Easy to assemble, clear directions, etc.Using for the first time this afternoon.What happened to the shipping protocols? The product was shipped in its primary package (SIOC), but was definitely not tamper evident - just a microflute tuck lock carton. Not even a piece of tape over the tuck lock to secure it - just the shipping label on the top of the box. At LEAST put the label over the tuck to keep someone from opening it. One of the side walls/corners was split, and some damage to the carton (punctures/dings), but I'm guessing that no other papers slipped out (the instructions were placed between the two parts).
