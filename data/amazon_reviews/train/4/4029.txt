This is such a neat all-in-one cleaning tool. I gave one to all my co-workers. They are all 18-24, pc gamers, constantly use ear buds. It's a perfect small gift. The only complaint I have is it's difficult to clean phone screens with the microfiber pad if you have a protective case. You can successfully clean the middle of the screen, but it's hard to get in the corners and on the sides. Taking off an otterbox is kind of a pain in the butt. Probably more suited for tablet screens, etc. Still a great gadget to keep on your desk.
