I'd gotten another slight variation of the Neewer light so knew what to expect. These put out an amazing amount of light for their size, and I've literally tossed a few of my older lights in favor of these. There's much less heat, cheaper to run, far less bulk, and zero cool-down time. The light temperature and light intensity are very easily controlled and the range is spectacular.The removable Fresnel lens disburses the light nicely, and with a pack of various color gels, I can get almost anything I want for a close shoot. It doesn't replace everything of course and they are definitely not the only lights you should have. Doing it again, I would probably opt for a barn door on all lights, but these are fine for how I use them, which is to just add a lot of light to the room.The downsides to this purchase aren't surprising. The carry packs are just too small for these, making it more of a chore than it needs to be to pack them up. The padding on the case is also a little light in my opinion. All that said, and while I won't be treating these carelessly, the price on these means I won't be overly upset if someone tripped over one and damaged it.
