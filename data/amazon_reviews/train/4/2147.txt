I was unsure how solid this would be ...I wanted both a wireless charging base and magnetic holder that could handle the weight of my iphone 14 plus with case. I was pleasantly surprised how this one performs. Initially I didn't want to mount it on the air vent, but it was the most ideal place and still have good peripheral vision of the road,etc. Another mount I got before this one was a Scosche mount is also magnetic but curisously won't hold the iphone I have...I had an older iphone for it and it required sticking a magnetic pad on the back of the phone, and, it only clamped to the vent with pre-fixed rubber grip. This one is so much better in that regard because it has a thumbwheel to REALLY clamp down the mount. My only critique, is the ball on the mount could have been made of metal imo, but it is plastic. It doesn't seem to be an issue yet though, so it may not be that big of a deal. Long term will tell I think. But overall this is an excellent mount that you can't go wrong with.
