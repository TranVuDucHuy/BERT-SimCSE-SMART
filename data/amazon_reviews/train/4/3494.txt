*Update*: customer service was very understanding and quick to send me a replacement cord through Amazon. They were very nice and accommodating. They also asked me to provide the batch number located on the cable so that they could ensure no further issues.I used this display to HDMI cord so that I could use two monitors simultaneously on my PC. In less than a year it has stopped working. I have tried different display ports and even a different computer. The cord is still not working.I have contacted their support staff about this and am hopeful for a replacement. Will update soon
