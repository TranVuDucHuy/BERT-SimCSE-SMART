When i first bought the camera i was a bit unsure about because of the price. But ive now had the camera for 7 months now and i can say i do not regret my purchase at all. I placed it outside of my house and it works perfectly and can withstand the cold and hot weather. One of the the only complaints i have is the quality when night vision is on is not so great, but other than that this is the best camera Iâ€™ve purchased.
