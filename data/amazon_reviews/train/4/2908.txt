Ordered these to go with my second set of 4 AirTags. Like the waterproof factor as I plan on keeping one in the back of our boat d so o I can track where the kids & grandkids are on our lake.I had trouble opening them until I realized they are soft and a simple twist or pressing the center of it. Then they came apart nicely. They are hard to reseal. I found I had to start at the top and work my way around, pressing every quarter inch. Iâ€™m hoping that gives a good seal.Rating would be a 5 if the seal was color coated like some zip lock bags.
