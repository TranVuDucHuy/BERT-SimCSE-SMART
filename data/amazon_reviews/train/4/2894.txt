If you’ve followed my reviews, you’ll know I once had a bluetooth speaker for use in my car (I’ll add a link for the product later). It finally died after about a year and a half, not being able to hold a charge anymore. So the search began for its replacement. I “settled” for this baby after noticing the wattage difference (40 to 10) and seeing that the size was a little bigger. Let me get the cons out of the way first: 1) It takes about maybe 15-20 seconds to be completely paired up from the time you power this up (by comparison, the first one was 5 seconds); 2) Even a portable unit should be able to be placed in a way where it doesn’t get thrown around in the back seat of a car with no audio system (then again, I might be the only person who bought this for that purpose); and 3) the included USB-C cord broke off within a week of use, right at the connector, but I was able to pull the metal part out with my fingers. That all said…? LISSEN. (lol) This mugg POUNDS. HUGE difference in power, even at lower volumes. I still can’t hear it over engine noise and if I have the windows down while in motion, but what do you expect at 40W? I mounted it so it can’t slide around as I drive, and I replaced the cord, but that longer pairing time is gonna take some getting used to…meh, what’s another ten sexonds, though, really? Anyway, I’m sure your use for this is more conventional, like for your kitchen while cleaning, or your outdoor beach or poolside party. This ain’t gonna make you miss the sound you get from better known brands, but it IS a viable enough substitute for the price point. Go ahead and take the chance on this.
