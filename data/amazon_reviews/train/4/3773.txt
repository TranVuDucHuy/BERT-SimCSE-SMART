I have been a Yi home user for 4 years. Now I have 5 Yi home Dome cameras, and 2 of this one. Yi has the best playback function I have seen so far. No fee, local storage, and 360 degrees. If there is anything they should improve:- The app latency is a bit high sometimes, even though I am also on the same wifi. Not related to wifi signal strength.- Sometimes the camera just dies, and I need to unplug/plug in the power. There are 2 symptoms when the camera dies: (1) you cannot see the image at all, stuck at 90% loading; (2) you can see the image, but you cannot move the camera.But overall it is worth the money.
