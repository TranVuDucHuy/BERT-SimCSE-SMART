These are terrible earbuds. Worst sound quality than the cheap ones I replaced. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere when buying earbuds.After the first day using these, I changed the silicone ear tips with a larger set from another brand of buds. Since then they work fine. I would recommend that Skull candy include larger tips for us big ear hole people
