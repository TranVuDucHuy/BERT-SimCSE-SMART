It has nothing to do with the projector, it works fine. Quiet fan, good picture, good sound. But the whole reason I bought it was to watch Hulu and Netflix in bed or in the bath and apparently these providers don’t allow you to project their videos (maybe due to copyright?). Either way it won’t play the video.
