Headphones are perfectly fine, they are comfortable. However Amazon advertises these as part of a package with a cable, that implies you might need the cable for these headphones. It is 100% a scam, you don't need the cable. So, now I have a cable that at least works for charging my phone, but I had zero need for it with the headphones since it doesn't even fit to them.
