**2022.12.27 EDIT**OK, I'll admit that originally I was less than thrilled, BUT I'll admit that this company worked to make it right, and it was truthfully rather unexpected. Not that I thought that the company was against such a thing, it's just that I had actually chalked up my latest purchase to being a done deal. Then OUT OF THE BLUE, I received an email from "Holly Maggieâ€œ asking me if something could be done to offset my unfortunate experience. To be honest, I'm a kind of busy guy, with demanding work, and demanding family obligations, and this small turn of events REALLY made my day... After a brief exchange, Holly and I reached a mutual agreement. Despite my original experience, this show of true customer service caused me to come back and give a better view of the company that stands behind this product. THAT speaks about character, and that in my humble opinion speaks greater volumes than the best headphones turned up to 10, but playing empty beats... no pun intended, and definitely NOT a plug for any headphones that have BEATS in their name, because I'm truthfully 100% NOT spending any money on THEM ðŸ‘€ðŸ¤¨, but I digressðŸ˜‚... Thank you Holly for your personal touch, people like you make living in a capitalism based society less painful... and causes me to believe that perhaps sometimes lemons do indeed actually give lemonade! :-)**END OF EDIT**The title IS accurate... I've rarely given a bad review of something, but let me tell you, these earbuds PISSED ME OFF... I began to notice that the case itself had issues charging, the earbuds charged as they should, but within 2 months the case which needs to be charged so that the buds will charge began to be an issue... I bought and tried different USB C chargers, but to no avail... the case simply wouldn't charge, the LED lights came on to show that the ear buds were charging, but the power level for the case never went up, it went down and finally was at 17% no matter what I did... so I finally threw them out of the window and I'll NEVER use this brand again!!!How was the sound? It was OK, it was a bit of a pain because the buds were very sensitive and as a result I accidentally hung up on calls quite a few times as I was reaching to adjust the buds better in my ears, that was a pain in the butt, but I lived with it... but the case not charging was the final straw... older, wiser, and NEVER will buy from them again...
