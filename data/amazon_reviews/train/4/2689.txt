Like others pointed out, the mount is not snug on the laptop screen with the weight of the phone tilting it backward. It is still a decent value, but you will need to pad the mount (or back laptop screen) to achieve a proper camera angle. The magnet is super strong and is holding iPhone 12 Pro through a silicone case no problem.
