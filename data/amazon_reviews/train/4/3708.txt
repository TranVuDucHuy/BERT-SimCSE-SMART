So I bought this around Thanksgiving and they worked wonderfully. They fit well in my ear, and doesn't feel like it's going to fall off. The sound quality is good. And in the beginning charging was not a problem. Now it's only January and the past few weeks the case will not charge. It will come on then cuts off. Not sure if I would buy another if this us going to happen within a month or so.
