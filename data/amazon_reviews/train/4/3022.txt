It turns out that the original V3 USB cord does not have data connections on it so that's why the socket was not being recognized by the camera. This was not written anywhere in the instructions but is buried in the FAQ somewhere on the site.The poorly trained support in the Philippines apparently are not aware of this either and so I only saw it in the reviews on amazon!I guess this is partially on me but why would they give you a slightly shorter power cord with this package and then have a disabled cord on the camera itself that has the longer cord? It's like they're setting the customer up to fail.At any rate, it works now about the same as all their other products - which is pretty good for the money but not great. My original review is below:I already had my V3 cam connected to a front porch via a $2 adapter I bought from Home Depot, but I thought it'd be nice to put a bulb in there too and have it come on when motion is detected or at night if I want to get more light. So I got this thing, screwed it in and plugged in the camera and so far so good until I tired to set it up.The router is literally 7 feet away from both the camera and the light socket and the camera has been working just fine but this thing does NOT connect. I have followed everything including a factory reset and it still does not work. I contacted WYZE and it was an overseas person who had zero knowledge beyond poorly reading the same things that are on the website.Given that I don't want a light bulb on 24/7, I'll likely return this and save the $15 with the home depot socket adapter.
