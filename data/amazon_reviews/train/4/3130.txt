I bought this to take on a mission trip to Honduras. We wanted to take pictures of kids and families as many have no pictures at all. Like the old Polaroids this will develop on their own in a couple of minutes. The film comes in a little pack of 10 prints, and is essentially ISO 800. Loading the film is very easy and only takes a few seconds. There is a built in flash, which does work, but for best pictures make sure you have good lighting - lots of lights on indoors, or be outdoors. Very bright outdoors can wash the picture out as well.Its a basic point and shoot camera. When you press the picture button, the print ejects out of the top of the camera. There is a manual zoom on the front, but I really didn't use it much. It came with a macro lens attachment, to take closeups, but I did not try to use it.I would not buy this camera for major keepsake photos, so I am not going to rate it comparing to a dslr or even decent phone camera. Its best used to provide an instant picture where developing time would be an issue - like handing out at a party, or like we did on a mission trip. I considered getting a small battery operated photo printer, but decided against it because of print time. We handed out over 100 prints at one visit, which we could never had done if we needed to print them. And it was a real joy watching the families and kids see the photos develop. We took well over 200 pictures with this camera, and will continue to use with grandkids and future mission trips.Final note - since film is essentially ISO 800, you should have it hand-checked when going through security - don't go through xrays.
