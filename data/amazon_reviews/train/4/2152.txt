These headphones are very nice and so far seem to be good quality. I like that the actual headphone / speaker can rotate; its a more "customizable" fit than other headsets I've had before. The only downside are the charging chords it comes with. The USB chord is a bit short, so unless you plan to charge them directly from your laptop or computer it is a bit inconvenient
