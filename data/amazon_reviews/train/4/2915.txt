I debated whether to purchase this or the Beats Pill. I chose this one due to the water resistant aspect of the JBL Flip 6 and the fact that the recipient often uses the device while in the shower. We recently used this while completing general chores and noted the ease of setup/connection. The sound quality is good for a speaker this size. It easily filled a living room/ dining room with fair quality music. Note, the speaker does seem easy to roll over as the base is not very large. I have not had a chance to test the battery life and may update this review if it is an issue.I have actually purchased two of these devices. Happily, I noted the two devices can be connected for a stereo effect.
