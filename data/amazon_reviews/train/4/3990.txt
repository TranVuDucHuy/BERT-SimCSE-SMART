I bought this to record our symphonic band performances, and it is much better than the built in mic on my Nikon DSLR. It produces clear audio and good low end sounds. I had a hard time getting the mic into the red bracket, so I just leave it attached in the case. Just be sure you hook up the cord correctly and you'll be good to go!
