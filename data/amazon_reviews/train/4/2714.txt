I’ve purchased three pairs of these so far, and not because I’ve had to replace any. I got my original pair from the local Walmart and loved them. Since then, they’ve been the number one requested item for birthdays for my kids. We now have my original pair in black, my son has the green pair, and my daughter has the sand pair.They sound good, pair quickly with both android and iOS, and the change lasts a good long while.My oldest daughter has a pair of expensive beats buds that she regrets purchasing because these have better battery life and sound nearly as good. The only thing her beats do that these don’t is active noise cancellation.The ear hooks make these perfect in the gym and I went so long between charges that I lost count of the months. That’s with 1-2 hour workouts at high volume 5 days a week.The only reason this isn’t a five star product at this price is because if their weird charging system. I’d much rather a usb-c port than what they have
