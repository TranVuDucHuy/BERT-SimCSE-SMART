These are comfortable and arrive with a small carrying case, multiple tips. They do not have active noise cancellation, but as others have said they block noise well due to shape of ear bud. They don’t hurt my ears like AirPods (basic, regular and Pro all feel bad to me) do. I did not think I needed a microphone, but you cannot walk down the street with your phone in your pocket-others can’t hear you and the rubbing in the pocket makes them think you just got thrown into a trash compactor. If you don’t plan to talk on the phone, these work quite well.. I don’t think they will last super long, but at this price, I also don’t care if I lose them (which after throwing away accidentally a great but no longer avail Bose pair-is how I got here) Sound quality is surprisingly good. I would like to find the same pair with a microphone.
