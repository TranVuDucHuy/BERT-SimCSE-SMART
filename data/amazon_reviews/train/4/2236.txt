Overall the headphones are pretty nice. The sound quality to me is just as good as my previous galaxy buds. There are plenty of eartips to find one that suite your ear. The be aware mode passes through sound way better than my previous experience with other buds. Having ear hoops to hold them on my head is just what I was looking for in an ear bud.My only real complaint don't know how it happened but the buds unpaired from each other. Which is annoying as you have to unpair them from your phone to pair them back together. Then after repairing them if you changed any of the tap resets you have to change them again.Update. Had complained about the buds needing a longer soft plastic to protect the ear canal. They included them in the packaging they named them tall medium and tall large.
