I bought this for a trip to Devil's Tower and other places I wanted to video. I was attempting to video the Grand Teton Mountains and it was only recording in b & w then a few moments later it wouldn't record, just kept asking me it I wanted to format the chip in the camera. Obviously not, I'd erase all the other picts I'd taken. I thought I'd gotten a bad camera and was quite upset. Later, I discovered, when the battery is low it starts doing these things. Be Aware, plug it in when not in use, keep your battery charged and this is a pretty good camera for the money.
