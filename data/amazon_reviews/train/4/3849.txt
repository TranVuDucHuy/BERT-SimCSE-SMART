These are decent bino's and I've owned 2 pair for different uses. After purchasing the second pair I found the "MADE IN CHINA" sticker tucked deep between the hinge swing which was disappointing but thought whatever, they're still good quality optics. Just to satisfy my curiosity, I bought a "cheap" off-brand pair to compare the two. Aside from the price, there was absolutely no difference in quality. In fact, apart from a few minute differences, the two are identical in every way. Do a quick search before you buy these and you'll save yourself a hundred bucks or more.
