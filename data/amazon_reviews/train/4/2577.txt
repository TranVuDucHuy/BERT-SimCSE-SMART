So far this camera has performed better than I expected honestly. The fact that it doesn't have to be within 5' my router to function as if it were makes it worthwhile. I've been using another top selling brand of cameras for years and recently started the process of swapping them out with Zumimall in hopes of better picture quality and notification accuracy. I was pleasantly surprised with a few of the customization options I didn't know about before purchasing. Overall I'd recommend it. Just as long as the price doesn't sky rocket.
