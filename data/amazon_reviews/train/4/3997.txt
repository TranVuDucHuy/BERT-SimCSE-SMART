The Q3 model is a great camera for the price. I have purchased it 3 times. I like the quality of the picture at night as well as in the day time. The motion detection works good. The 360 rotation of the camera is a bit choppy, but it works. The mounting hardware, the screws in peculiar need to be improved if you are mounting on anything other than wood. They donâ€™t work on stucco. Overall I would recommend this camera! I may get a 4th camera.
