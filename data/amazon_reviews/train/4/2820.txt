Ok, this one easy to set up and get the second monitor up and running.But as you keep working, interacting with the second monitor slows down to less than comfortable levels. The mouse pointer lags behind your movement around the screen. Further, the pointer goes from the normal size to a giant size leading to frequent confusions. I have to calibrate my mouse moves to account for the change in window size, the font size, and the pointer size when I move a window from my main display to the second one. Several display configuration changes have failed to improve the situation.I do not know if this is something unique to me, but having this unit plugged in and recording a Zoom video introduces some kind of a humming noise at the very beginning of the recorded audio. And this happened *ONLY* the one time I was plugged into the second monitor when recording the video.Maybe this is something you may want to test.Not the best, but it definitely has helped me in situations when I needed a second monitor with my laptop (with a busted HDMI port).
