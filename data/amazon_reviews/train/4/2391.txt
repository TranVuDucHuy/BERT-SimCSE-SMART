This projector is great at its price because it's actually a 1080p image. My biggest problem with it is the fact that it doesn't have Bluetooth for audio - meaning that if you want to connect it to external speakers, you would need to do it with an aux cord, which is not at all convenient. The speakers on it absolutely suck. The projector has vertical (up-and-down) tilt correction, but not left to right that's huge that's an important feature to have with projectors like this, and not having it leaves a lot to be desired.All that being said, this thing is so good for the price. Most projectors in this price range are nowhere near as good. The picture quality is fantastic. It comes with a remote to control the menu.Just keep in mind that the projector itself is not very smart. This thing works great with something like a Roku or Amazon fire stick. Basically, you'll need to use its HDMI port to get anything working.I like that the menu has options such as changing screen size and fine-tuning its color and sharpness.It actually came with a screen and hanging hooks which is pretty convenient.All in all, I would purchase it again.
