I rated it 5 stars in every area outlined. However, I gave it a 4 star rating because the arm is rather short. It makes it a little challenging if you are singing while playing a keyboard. It forces you to lean in a bit.I am 5’5 and I imagine it would be challenging for a taller person. I could be wrong.I really can’t complain. It is a great package for the price. More lightweight than expected. But the assembly was easy and instructions straight forward. I recommend it for anyone who needs a stand at an economical price. It is meeting my needs. Thankful.
