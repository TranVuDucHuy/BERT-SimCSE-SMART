These earbuds are different from most that they don't require a rubber plug to sit directly in the ear canal. IF the shape of your ears is compatible, they sit in a bend of the outer ear. The online manual shows and illustration whereby the buds are held "correctly" in a more or less vertical position, and "incorrectly" in a more horizontal position. There's no way that the earbuds will provide good sound in my ears in the "correct" position, but luckily the "incorrect" position is fine. I would not expect the full fidelity of a pair of expensive in-ear earbuds, but they are certainly sufficient for casual listening to music, and have sufficient bass and treble response. I especially like that they can be charged in their battery-containing case, and that the case itself can be charged wirelessly with or without the earbuds inside. As far as noise cancellation is concerned, that is not what I purchased these earbuds for, and I would imagine it would not be anywhere nearest effective as something that creates an actual physical seal. I find that I can walk around with them without having to worry about them falling out, but as far as intense physical activity, probably not. Again, it all depends on how well these fit in your ears.
