Â Watch my video reviews in HD on my Youtube channel: skyforce95General Notes:-no battery, requires a wired usb connection to power at all times-doesn't come with a usb wall adapterPros:-value pack: 3 tripod stands, 3 led panels, 3 sets of RYBW plastic inserts-able to adjust brightness levels-gets pretty bright but don't expect spotlight levels of brightness - adequate for supplementing existing ambient light-two places for adjusting height-easy to assembleCons:-can only fit two plastic cards so unable to mix colors without removing the white matte card-overall construction feels cheap-feet of tripod legs don't have much grip to them, plus the feet spread isn't very wide - be wary of them getting knocked over-tripod screw attachment for the led is built very strangely. The platform is able to rotate but it doesn't facilitate the screwing in of the led
