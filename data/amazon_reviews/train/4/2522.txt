Used this to examine some engine parts up close. Works pretty well as far as picture quality and connecting to the phone is great.That being said, the results are a lot better when you can adjust the position of your part smoothly and not holding it in your hand as it will just move too much to get focus and results.In particular the little stand it comes with is just very basic and would be better with some adjustment screws.When adjusting the zoom, by turning the end of the microscope - you end up having to reset the position of the microscope because the stand is so light it shifts around on you.Overall for the money I thought this was a good item and I hope to reuse it for other projects in future.
