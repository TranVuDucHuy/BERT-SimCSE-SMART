I was a little worried because I saw some reviews saying the photo quality was bad, but it was exactly what I was expecting from an instant camera which is a good thing. If you want super crisp 4k pictures, dont buy this, but if youre looking for a nice nostalgic vibe it is perfect. It is very easy to use and I really like how it looks. The end.
