We love the camera! It's extremely durable, we use it sitting on the windowsill of our 2 year old daughter's room. The pictures are very clear, especially the night vision. For the price my husband and I are very pleased. This versatile little camera had been worth every penny. I would like the camera even more if the blind spots weren't as big as they are.... My daughter's room is 20x20 even when we mounted it up.in the corner there were still large blind spots. It seems to have less blind spots on the lower level more toward the middle of the room. I'd also like the camera to have the capability to be used outside of wifi. Other than those small issues it's been great for us. It has lasted longer and functioned better then the fancy baby camera we bought when she was born!
