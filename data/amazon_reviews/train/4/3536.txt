I had the Jaybird Vista and absolutely loved them, but I lost one of the buds (didn't have the location tracker on - oops). The Vista weren't available anymore, so I had to go with the Vista 2.Overall, I like them. Jaybirds fit well in my ears, the buttons are convenient, and the sound quality is great. They connect easily for first time use to many different devices. The Vista 2's ability to switch between surround sense and noise cancelling makes them really versatile.However, I liked the Vista better, and wish I could have bought them again. The Vista 2's connection with my phone drops out a lot if I'm switching between apps (like if I listen to music and then want to quick switch to a Youtube video). This is super annoying while working out when I don't have the case with me to reset the connection. The case is slippery and hard to open. I often drop it, and then the buds inevitably fall out and shoot across the floor. I'm worried I'll lose one of them. I put on the location tracker, but that drains the battery quicker. I think the Vista had a better battery life.Happy with the product fit and features, but could have been better if the connection didn't drop out.
