I bought this product to use when I start traveling on long flights but I decided to test try it at home before traveling to get used to it, now I use it on a continual basis. During the Christmas holidays the mask fit around my eyes comfortable enough to where with them open they were not bothered and still light was not able to come in. I wear a CPAP most nights and the mask fit over the mask comfortably enough to where I didn't feel encumbered wearing it. Those nights that I wasn't streaming music to sleep by, the earphones cancelled out most noise in the household good enough that I wasn't bothered by it, the only problem I encountered was controlling the volume on the mask, the switches under the pad would not connect all the time, if you're going to be wearing this full time and using the speakers to listen to music or whatever, I would recommend charging the mask about every two days. I had no trouble synching the mask with both my tablet and phone.
