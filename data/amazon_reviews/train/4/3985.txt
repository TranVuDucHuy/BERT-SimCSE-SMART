This is a pretty decent backdrop. I’m at got a nice sturdy material, not too sheer so as to have things show through but if you wanted to backlight it, it would show nicely.It took some doing to get the wrinkles out of it. I don’t think I actually got them all out from its folded state from the packaging but I was able to stretch it on my stand with clamps to remove any for photos.
