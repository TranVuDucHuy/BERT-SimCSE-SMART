So gone are the days of me needing my ladder to swap out backdrops. This was pretty easy to install, only downside was there were no screws beyond the wall studs so I needed to get specialty screws to install into my manafrotto poles. But thatâ€™s less of their fault and more of how I rigged it. I do wonder if the plastic chains will hold up to the use but overall easy to install. Solid build. And will save me so much time and effort in the future! Would purchase again.
