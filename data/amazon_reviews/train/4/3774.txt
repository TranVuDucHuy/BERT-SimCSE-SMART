I live alone and got this to keep an eye on my cat while I was gone for a week and to make sure the pet sitter was coming. Like others have said, the night vision is great, and being able to hear sounds live from the camera is nice. It does constantly pop up to pay for their cloud, though, which is 100 dollars for a year. I certainly don't have that kind of money and wish I could turn the pop-up every time I open the camera feed off. That being said, the live camera feed is definitely good enough for what I bought the camera to do! It does catch some activity, but it seems pretty inconsistent, and also cannot differentiate between my cat and a person. It will send me "person detected" when my cat walks by in the middle of the night, which is either quite a fright when I'm not home, or maybe would cause me to disregard the message if a burglar actually did come in. Also, I think it will only record activity in 5 minute intervals or so. It will take a screenshot when it detects the activity, but without the subscription, you can only see a tiny thumbnail of the picture. Which, again, is enough to be able to tell my pet sitter came, or perhaps see my cat's tail somewhere in the frame, but no more than that.All in all, it's a great little camera that certainly will do what it needs you to do, but the more convenient options are locked behind a paywall that may not be affordable to some like myself.
