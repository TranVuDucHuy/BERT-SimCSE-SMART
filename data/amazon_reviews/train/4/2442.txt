This is an inexpensive camera system. We use it in the barns to check the animals. It is not the best available but works for us. Night vision is black & white & fuzzy. But you can zoom in and it has a spot light feature. Our older Arlo camera had a magnetic base which I preferred bc we could put it on the pipe fence anywhere. This Arlo set actually needs to be screwed into the wall which is not as convenient. But the cameras are well made and affordable.
