We love these picture frames and ended up buying multiple of them for family members. They are easy to setup and work reliably even with very large playlists full of many photos. The screen quality is great and the ability to have short videos is a plus. I docked one star due to the fact that in order to really get everything out of these, they want you to upgrade to a monthly fee plan. Without it, you only get a certain amount of storage, playlists, shares, and your video length is limited to 15 seconds. Lastly, a minor nitpick is that the shuffle algorithm seems to often repeat the same pictures frequently even in a shuffled playlist of over 1000 photos. Overall, this is a great digital picture frame even without the subscription and I would buy again.
