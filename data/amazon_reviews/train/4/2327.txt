I bought two of these to use in our bedroom, as there is just one outlet on the wall behind our bed, and my wife and I each have a bedside lamp, and a couple of devices that need to charge on our night stands.The plug has a nice low profile, allowing us to push our bed right up against it without damaging the cord in any way. The only complaint I have is that the cord comes out of the plug at a set angle, meaning that since I’m running each of the power strips in different directions, one of them has to kind of loop around, in order to go the direction I need it to go (if that doesn’t make sense, see the attached photo).Other than that one minor thing, these seem to be great power strips. The cable is braided, which should mean better longevity, and the USB ports give plenty of power to charge my iPhone, Apple Watch, and iPad at a pretty reasonable speed. Plus, it’s nice to de-clutter the ground by getting rid of those bulky charging blocks and plugging straight into the USB port on the power strip itself.
