ATTN: only uses up to 32gb SD card. Don’t buy 128gb like I did.PROS: Good for 90s/00s style vlogs/videos or documenting moments with friends. Don’t expect crystal clear video all the time. That’s the nostalgic charm of it.Very compact. Easily fits in a crossbody bag/tote.Conversation starter.CONS: misleading product info regarding SD card size.Can only charge with screen open.Batteries seem to drain quickly.User manual not the best.
