Let me start off by saying the materials and “fit/finish” is excellent. But things begin to go downward from there.The #1 culprit and complaint of the system is DJI’s penchant for not labeling the connecting ports of the SC2 in a clearly identifiable, logical and legible way. I’m sorry DJI, but “tiny doesn’t cut it.”Secondly, the “mish-mash” of required connecting cables comes off as some kinda “joke” from a company that positions itself as “high tech.” It’s as though DJI never heard of “plug-and-play.” I don’t want excuses from DJI… I want simplicity and workable solutions. I want this thing to be so easy to set up, that “granny or grandpa” can do it while they’re sitting in their La-Z-Boy recliner. DJI needs to rethink and reimagine gimbal connectivity.Moving on to the unit itself: I’ve got an 18W charger hooked up to the SC2, and the charge rate barely budges. “Wat up wit dat??” 🙄 Now, I do own an Apple 96W charger, but I feel that amount of power shouldn’t be required.Lastly, my preference in using the gimbal is stationary, atop a Manfrotto tripod (with a pan head), with an mounted iPhone and RavenEye transmitter. But I’m here to tell ‘ya, this camera/gimbal/smartphone combo is no lightweight. If I was to carry my Sony A6600 (with a 18-135) and the gimbal, after 5 minutes, I’d be “done.”But enough of my “whining and gesticulating.” The RSC2 is an excellent addition to my stable of photo capturing equipment. It delivers exciting new capabilities and possibilities to the solo photographer once thought of as impossible.….. and after a few “fits-and-starts”, I think you’ll enjoy it too.
