I don't have an external flash on my camera so I needed additional lighting for my macro shots. This little light is a great piece of equipment. In addition to the regular lighting you get a multitude of colors to play around with on your shots and also a bunch of different effects (some of which I'll never use but it's nice to have them). I thought about buying the name brand light that started all this but it's SO much more expensive for my use I won't get my money's worth. I have a few other Ulanzi products and I've very satisfied with them and their brand.This video light is easy to use (once you figure out how to change the settings, colors and effects) and is very compact except when you're using the diffuser. For some reason they decided to make the diffuser twice as bit as the light so when it's on it's a bit bulky. Not a total dealbreaker. I also have one other small gripe...When you turn the brightness up or down there is a little switch you press up or down. If you don't have small fingers it's a bit challenging to use it and even harder when you're going thru the different modes and also using the brightness. Again, not a dealbreaker.If you are a amateur photographer who isn't a blogger or professional videographer this will more than suffice for your needs. I can't comment on the battery life since I just received the light and I haven't had it long enough to have the battery run down.
