I wanted cameras to let me know when someone pulls into my driveway and/or comes to the front or back door. This cameras seem quite solid and sturdy. They were easy to connect to phone and tablet via the Reolink app. Mounting wasn't too bad other than trying to find the best position for the solar panel to receive enough sunlight for charging.The picture is great during the day, not so much at night unless there are lights on in the area.There seems to be too much lag to when recording starts. Often whatever set the alert off is already gone or just barely in the cameras view anymore. The camera at the front door doesn't start recording until person is already at the door or even going inside already. The driveway camera doesn't start recording until vehicle is at the camera or mostly past it.At least the alert tone lets me know that something is outside and I can check my phone or tablet.Was not at all impressed with talk feature - not clear and seems to be delayed too.Still playing with features and hoping some adjustments will improve the shortcomings.
