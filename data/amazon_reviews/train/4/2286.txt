Edit: Update with the photo. I still love this pen, but this has happened twice and this last time it fell off it almost got lost.I wish the construction and material of the button was more solid and "in" there, since it is placed at a pressure point, its where I hold the pencil. :( 4 out of 5 for now I guessAfter I received this one I don't think Ill ever go back to the surface pen. The surface pen's original tip would constantly fracture due to it being thin and sticking out of it awkwardly. Not to mention it being weirdly rubbery.This pen addresses the original surface pen issues. It is lightweight, thin, and the tip is hard plastic and pencil shaped. Because of this, its very easy to draw detailed. I also appreciate there being an extra pen nib.The only thing I will say is that the charger port does not have a cover, so dust could get in there. Personally Im not bothered by it since its a USB type c port so I know its not getting inside the pen itself.If you're an artist I can't recommend this enough! I love how it feels with the iCarez matte screen, there's enough tooth so that its not too slippery on just smooth glass.
