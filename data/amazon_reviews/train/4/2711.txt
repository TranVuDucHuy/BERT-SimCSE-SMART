I bought these in November, still going strong! I've dropped them from high places, and stepped them multiple times, so they're pretty durable! The sound quality is pretty good. The bass boost is okay, I wouldn't recommend using it though, I would recommend using the JLab signature. By the way, these don't come with a regular charging cord, so make sure to get a charging box! (One that you would use for your phone charger)
