Multiple reviews have indicated how sensitive this microphone is. Either I got a dud, or it's not as sensitive as suggested. I had to get within about 6 inches for this mic to pick up my voice at a decent volume in Windows 11 with Win11 input volume at 100%. My Blue Yeti is definitely superior (and over twice the cost).I am not using any software to modify the audio (and don't plan to).
