i use the Lamicall Gooseneck for my Galaxy S22+, and i have found that it fits snuggly and is easy to secure. i feel like the phone holder may be a tad too loose at times, but they are sufficient for many household and indoors purposes. great for watching videos in bed or at my desk; however, for many counters, you may find that the Lamicall Gooseneck's clamps are too small to promote complete confidence over its security, and i have found that simply tugging at the phone holder at the right angle will slip the clamps off its position.i would not recommend using the Lamicall Gooseneck for any outdoor shooting, and that is clearly not its purpose. the Lamicall Gooseneck shakes easily, so it is crucial that any photographer gives the phone holder ample time to steady and realign.i have used the Lamicall Gooseneck as a stand for some unintended purposes as well. it works great as a hat stand, and i have attached cat toys to the neck and to the phone holder with great success as it bounces so easily to entertain my kittens.overall, a fine product for indoors use that will probably be usable for longer than you would need it for. i recommend considering the price seriously.
