This is a good product but it is long and hangs long from a collar. Great for larger dogs but too long for the puppy it was purchased for. Also, the silicone loop where the metal ring fits through seems a little thin. I am thinking it might break off after a bit of use, especially if the pup is outside much. We are trying it with our adult golden.
