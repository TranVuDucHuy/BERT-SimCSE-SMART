It is an inexpensive convenient bluetooth speaker. Nothing super great, but is decent sound quality and serves its purpose. I love it for its mobility. You can take it anywhere.If you are particular and have very high standards for sound quality, this unit is not for you. The sound is good and will satisfy most people. For me, there are times when I want exceptional sound quality and this speaker isn't adequate, but I can't pick up the system that means my high standard and take it anywhere with me.
