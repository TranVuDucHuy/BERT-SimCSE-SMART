I like the headset its light and comfortable I do swap ears every couple of hoursThe only thing is that when I'm speaking to customers they can still hear my dog in the background it's not a bad thing for me it was a good price and connects via Bluetooth to my phone so that I'm able to type with both hands and don't have to hold my phone to my ear anymore the setup is super easy I would recommend this to others as well
