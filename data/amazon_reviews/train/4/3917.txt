Husband and I bought this to replace a similar Optoma DLP projector that we had for ~6 years. For the same price point now, this one is way brighter. We used to have to wait until dark to see anything properly on a projector, but this one is still super clear in the middle of the day (barring direct sunlight of course). That aspect alone is worth the upgrade for us, because we can get way more use out of it. The picture is very good; colors are bright and accurate. I also love the focus knob; since it's so big, it offers very fine control and it's easy to get it focused perfectly.The only cons I have are small: (1) It takes a really long time to turn on and switch inputs compared to other projectors I've had. Not a big deal, just a little annoying. (2) No dust filter! I don't know why Optoma doesn't think dust filters are necessary. Apparently they only include them in "dusty climates," whatever that means. Without one, dust will collect in the projector and make it more likely to overheat and have parts break down (that's what happened to our last one multiple times). If you are tech savvy enough, you can open the projector up every so often and vacuum the dust out to make sure the projector lasts a long time. Also just make sure you place it in a well-ventilated spot / not right up against a wall and definitely not in an enclosed space like a cubby shelf. Don't just rely on the projector telling you when it's too hot, something could be damaged or starting to melt a little before the built-in sensors go off.For future reference, if something does go wrong, don't be afraid to fix it yourself. The most common issue I've had with DLP projectors is a bad color wheel. If your colors start flashing weirdly and you hear whirring/clicking from the projector, it's probably the color wheel. You can get a new one online for <$30 and replace it yourself. Just look up a video.
