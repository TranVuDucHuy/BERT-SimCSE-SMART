I am beyond grateful and love that I finally got this to do my videos! It sits perfect on my desk and it has great lighting for what I need it for. However, it is not up for balancing acts lol. Whenever you tip the head over to look down at the desk or my hands it topples over. Because it’s on my desk I was able to put one of my monitor legs on it to keep it upright. It also scares me to put my phone in the holder because it’s hard to get it in and out. Love that it can hold my phone. Don’t love that I have to be slow and gentle with it because I’m afraid it will break the clamp. I’m going to have to get a creator kit that comes with a camera so I don’t have to take my phone in and out all the time. I can just sit the camera in and leave it there. Once I do that I’m sure I won’t be worried about it.I did a test run to see what it would look like for my YouTubing and such. And it’s definitely a hit! Love that it can do what I need it to do.
