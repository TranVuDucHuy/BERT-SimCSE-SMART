I like the price and how easy this is to pull out and put away. The picture quality is good, but the sound is often not enough even in our small room so I think we will have to get a sound bar. The biggest disappointment is that it is advertised that this can stream from our phones and that is simply not the case. If it streams at all the sound quality is horrendously distorted, and without video.But streaming from our streaming platforms is a nonstarter and will not happen.You must have something connected with the hdmi cable to be able to watch anything at all.
