Everyone has posted about how easy this is to install so I feel for it. It’s not all sunshine and roses based on where you install it so please beware. I installed my tv on an exterior wall so there was insulation behind the drywall. The enclosed drill bit worked perfectly but it broke thru the insulations backing. I’m sure it’s because I didn’t know better. Also the insulation appears to be stuck to the backside of the drywall so there is no way to feed the cord between the two. I have tried for over an hour to feed the cord thru the wall but it is feeding thru the insulation and keeps getting stuck. Now to save my sanity I’m purchasing fish wire praying this helps me get the wire thru the wall. I still think this will be a great product - once installed.
