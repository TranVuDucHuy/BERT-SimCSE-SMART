I charged it fully overnight and then I played it outside (in winter) from 9 AM to 2 PM, when the battery went dead. I charged it fully overnight, repeated the same the next day, and again, after 5 hours, battery went dead. Cold weather and full volume may have been a contributor? (I don't know, only a guess.) But I bought it because it said had 12 hours of battery life, and I only got 5 hours.
