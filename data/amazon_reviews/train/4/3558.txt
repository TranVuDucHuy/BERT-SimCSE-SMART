This is an extremely impressive product that has met or exceeded all the manufacture's claims for their product and my high expectations, except for one big problem that is now solved: product reliability. After two weeks of use, one of the two wireless transmitters in this product froze hard and could not be reset (it became completely non-responsive and stopped working while stuck on). Thankfully, Amazon's standard product support stepped up to the rescue (I did not purchased Amazon's extended warranty). To my amazement, I reached a product support specialist within 2 minutes and presto! Amazon sent me a replacement at no charge which arrived the next day. All's well that ends well! I continue to be very pleased with this tiny and oh-so-useful and powerful sound system.
