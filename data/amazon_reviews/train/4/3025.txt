Can be a bit shakey when using device but has a thicker/stronger arm than other versions. I wish it were more adjustable at the base screw rather than being made more to attach to a horizontal platform but I see this is common throughout most versions. I bought 2 different types due to the idea being handy in 2 different locations. The claw type attachment like this one has less issue with larger phones that have a case but I have to make sure I physically put pressure to close the claw on the device to ensure its tight. I have seen my device slowly sliding out and also found my device on the floor when left for a long period of time. Overall I'm satisfied.
