This projector is a decent value for the price you pay. I use it with my fire stick and it puts out a decent image for me at a range of about 8 feet. My one complaint after almost two months of regular use is that it's impossible to clean the mirror inside. It's beginning to collect tiny amounts of dust and it shows up on the projected image. I'll have to buy a special screwdriver to take it apart and clean. Very annoying.
