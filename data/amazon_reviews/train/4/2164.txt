Exactly what I was expecting although it kinda stinks that the top of the case will have a hard time holding on after a month or so. In the end I stuck a small amount of super glue on the top so it help on better. I ruined my last set of AirPods because they kept getting dropped. Doesn’t matter what it looks like if it doesn’t work. Product does its job although I’m sure the AirPods design makes it difficult to design a case that won’t lose retention/form over time. Super glue was a small sacrifice. If you needed a new case a razor blade would make short work of removing the case and you’d be onto another.
