Everything works great, but there is a difference between a cable and the Getaria tone. It’s slightly thinner with a little less snap. It also doesn’t like active electronics. I have a Clapton 25db boost on a Strat and I can hear a hint of a whine. I would suggest tweaking your amp eq or use an eq/boost pedal to overcome the drop in fullness. Otherwise, they’re great to walk around with without dragging the cable, especially in the house. Would I play live with them? Well, my buddy is with the 5.8GhZ model. He has the same tone drop as I do, but he uses an EQ to bring it back up. All in all, a great unit and would recommend it if you’re a player and not a tone perfectionist. If you want to record, use a cable. If you want to fool around in the house or on a small stage, then they’re pretty freeing. Couldn’t beat the price.
