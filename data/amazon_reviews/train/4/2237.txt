I have hearing issues (some hearing loss but also cannot tolerate loud sounds) and was looking for an ear bud that I could go for walks with and didn't have to turn the volume way up to drown out the traffic sounds. I decided to give these a try and was very happy with the outcome. The noise cancellation worked great and the sound quality was good. The only reason I gave the sound quality less stars is that sometimes the bluetooth would drop out and the audio would stop. It seems to happen mostly when it's very windy out.Customer service gets 5 stars because they responded with 24 hours and honored their warranty when one of my ear buds stopped working. I was given a full replacement.I would definitely recommend these - just make sure you use them with the noise cancelling only in public places because you wouldn't be able to hear someone coming up behind you.
