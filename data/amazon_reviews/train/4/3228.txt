I've been using ND filters for a long time. On my original Mavic Pro and even with my Canon R5 rig. These are great filters and are easy to install. The only improvement Freewell could do is to redesign the case so that you can store the original DJI camera cover (the one you take off to install the ND filter). There may be cases when you don't want to use an ND (shooting at night for instance) and I wanted to be able to save and reinstall it. If you put the DJI cover in the Freewell case, the case lid won't close due to the difference in thickness. A minor grip, granted, but one that could have easily have been solved by making the rubber case insert thinner and/or the case lid slightly larger.
