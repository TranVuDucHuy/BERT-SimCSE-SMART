For my fellow autists, the noise cancelling will definitely help take the edge off, but also creates a slight pressure in my ears. My cartilage is also really sensitive so I can’t wear these for more than 30-45 minutes before my ears start to hurt. At this point I’ve tried so many headphones I don’t think I will ever find a set that are pain free so that’s why I rated these highly. They are good for the price and I really love the bright blue!
