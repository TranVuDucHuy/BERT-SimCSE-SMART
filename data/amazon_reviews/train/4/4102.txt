So I bought it for the guest room since my sister was visiting long-term. I wanted something that was easy to hang and have easy access to cabling.I'm happy to report that it met my goals. Very simple to assemble and bolt to the wall. Since the wall I was using it's not a firewall I added anchors to the center where there's no studs.I used my own hardware and this is typical of most of these cheap mounts. The included mounting hardware correspond to furring strips or wood studs which were not present in my case. I had to use metal screws for framing metal studs.It only gets 4 stars because it did not include hardware for metal studs. Otherwise, it is solid as long as you don't hang anything above rated capacity.
