This gimbal itself was pretty great. However the raven unit that came as a combo was faulty. I would definitely order it again, but just not from this seller. It has been over two weeks, and I have not received any refund or response from them. Amazons customer service advised that if I haven't received the refund in 30 days that they (Amazon) will refund my money automatically.
