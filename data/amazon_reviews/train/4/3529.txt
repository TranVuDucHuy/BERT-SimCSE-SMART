So as a new watch owner, I wasn't sure what I was ordering. I thought this little device would go on my keychain and be able to charge my watch wherever. Not the case. It does need to be plugged into a USB port. It is small and convenient. Depending on the port, it may be difficult to charge. But not a bad option and easy to carry around. No wires to worry about or special port needed. Works with the standard USB ports and plugs.
