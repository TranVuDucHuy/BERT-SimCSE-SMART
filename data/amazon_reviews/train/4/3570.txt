Nice looking power strip, nice ergonomics, nice length of power cord, seems substantial....but... installing it safely might just be a problem...On the back of the strip it's printed into the black plastic "Do not install this device if there is not at least 10 meters (30 feet) or more of wire between the electrical outlet and the electrical service panel."Ok, what's THAT about and how does Joe Average accomplish that miracle?Most homes have the wiring installed in the walls and invisible - so there's no real way to tell if there's 30 feet of wire between the outlet and the electrical service panel short of tearing out the walls and measuring the wires... like that's ever going to happen...Most folks will plug it in without a second thought. Hmmm.....
