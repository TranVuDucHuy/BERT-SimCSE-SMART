Good picture and good audio. 👍 The Pocket 1 had weak audio. The recording volume on it was a little low. This one is much better. 🤗 Picture quality is good and it's a little better in low light or at night with the exposure. The sharpness is ok. Face tracking is much better. It finds the face and centers it better. Loss of FT is less than before. Recovery of FT is better. Settings are changeable on the camera without the app. There might be 1 or 2 but I don't think so.The app. It's less intrusive than before. It only needs location and storage or camera. But they might be sneaky about it as they require you to agree to their terms. This time send reports or data send is off from out of the box. At least mine was. Hooking up to the app was faster and smoother this time. Literally took a couple of seconds. Could be because I already had an account. I didn't get any FW update notices or FW updates. Already came with the new one.The accessories are cool and good quality. The mini tripod is nice. The external mic is pretty cool BUT it's a little on the low side. You have to hold it pretty close to your mouth for good audio. They need to update the mic recording level. I bumped up the audio on both the external mic to 20dbs and up on the on board mics. The onboard microphones are better than the external mic. Its louder. The quality may be slightly better. Still though it's pretty cool they have a wireless external mic with this. The adapter is way smoother than the plug adapter you had to use with the original pocket. Cleaner look.Tripod screws everywhere. 🙂 A piece you can attach to the pocket 2 one on the extension piece and one on the case. No more rubber strap. The case holds the camera snuggly with or without the wide angle lens. Another cool add on that I purchased for the original pocket. POV is much better than the pocket 1 with or without the WAL. The magnet could be slightly stronger. I lost it once.Another cool thing is the connector pieces the usb c and lightening and wide angle lens fit inside the case. Theres slots for them. 😮What needs improvement? Well the mic level on the external mic. The battery goes fast on the camera. The mic lasts a little bit longer. You might be able to squeeze 90min of straight recording. Recording doing shorter clips adjusting reviewing flipping back n forth in an hour you'll have maybe 30% left. Give or take.The magnet on the WAL needs to be a little stronger. The thumb stick needs to be just a tad stiffer as I find I'm pressing down when I'm just trying to move the directional. The price 😳 $500 plus about $30 in tax yikes. You gotta think about it.Overall I like it. It's better than the first one but still needs some minor tweaks and they can add some things. Throw in a lav mic. Those don't cost too much. Make it to where you can 2 external mics connected. Increase battery life and maybe put in an extended battery in that mic adapter. 😊 I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the high price and audio level on the external mic. Oh and uh the wind screen dead bug is really lose on the external mic. You can easily knock it off. For some thoughts and samples ... YouTube. 😎
