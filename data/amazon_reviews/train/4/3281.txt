This is my first monitor, I purchased this monitor so I may see my shots better than using the viewfinder/3 inch screen on my Canon 5DM4. I had already purchased a battery adapter to work with my existing batteries. Pros: great size, great backlight especially with the sunshade provided, very articulate with included ball head. Cons: I must say that every time I power off the monitor, then on, the CAMERA MODE category on the monitor's screen turns OFF. I have to go through the settings and turn it on back to 1080i to get a full screen picture after I take my shot. Also, there is NO BATTERY INDICATOR to tell you how much battery you have left to power the monitor. No touch screen to change camera settings on the monitor-this is for viewing only, and you will have to rely on using your camera's physical settings, because the Canon 5DM4 does not give you a dual screen on its own viewfinder in camera mode. You can use both screens in video mode, but you need to go into settings to enable it. I recommend getting a separate rig to mount this and not using the hotshoe although you could, but you would have to take it off when moving shot to shot unless you are doing video.For the price, it's a decent first monitor, and I can see where shooting videos would be a plus.
