Headphones work and fit well. I bought them specifically for the gym and the have been great. Stay put no matter what the head movements and the battery life is awesome. Sound quality is average for a bluetooth set in this price point and the noise cancelling is middle of the road. Max volume is on the low side tho which I assume is why the battery life is so good. Not recommended for noisy conditions or running heavy equipment, but for use in active, sweaty situations they're perfect.
