You absolutely must watch a YouTube video in order to use this properly. There is a clear way of using this unit.Once you get the phone connected to the eyepiece, it fits nicely into the scope eyepiece. Have patience because getting your phone to focus is a challenge. Best of luck. I've seen people get great images of Saturn and Jupiter using one of there holders and a phone. I have not been so fortunate.
