The disc is great for writing on the touch screen, though drawing would be somewhat of a pain. If you lift it, the disc doesn't stay in place. Instead, it hangs loosely. So you have to awkwardly reposition it onto the screen. It's a pain for people who hold a writing utensil at an angle like I do, and writing and doodling ends up looking scribbly. It also doesn't do well for just pokes. That's where the other side comes in. For everyday use on your touch screen, you need the larger side, which shines over the disc imo. The touch screen recognizes its touch more often, though not 100% of the time. That being said, neither end works on the waterfall edge of my Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. They don't register at all. Maybe there's a reason their advertising as a stylus for an iPad is so prominent.I find much cheaper styluses work better.
