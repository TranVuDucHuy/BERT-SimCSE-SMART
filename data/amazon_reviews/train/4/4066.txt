Overall it's a great speakerphone. I love that the cord wraps up when not in use. The sound quality is great and the microphone is also very good. My issues are small but after having used this everyday for 2 years these things irk me:- The mute button works but it only syncs up with the Teams or Zoom mute button if you use the dongle. When using the wired connection, which I sometimes prefer, they are not in sync.- Wish there was a headphone jack. Sometimes I need privacy and it would be super convenient to just plug in headphones on this thing and still be able to use the mic on the Jabra. Also don't like having to switch to a new device in my settings when I do use headphones.- sometimes the dongle has a lag in audio. That's why I prefer the wired connection but then the mute button isn't synced.- wish there was a place to store the dongle when not in use like some of the other speakerphones.That said, I tried several other speakerphone before settling on this and i can say it's better than the rest.
