Fast review 9 sticks works 1 did not. I do not feel like returning the package. I will ask for a 10% refund and see what happens. If the first one I loaded was the dead one. I may have returned it as I am not familiar with this brand name. The eight stick I loaded is the dead one. So I had sent the time to load 7 that worked I am not going to do a return. I will be busy next few days I hope I can take care of this on weds or this. I will post an update then.
