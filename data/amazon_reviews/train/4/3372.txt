Nice quality - can dislodge to reduce circumference easily enough, nice secure smartphone holder, easy to adjust angle of phone; however, I had to put it in the top coffee cup holder, and it isn't a snug fit. The two spaces on console where shifting stick is won't hold the phone holder, the fit is even worse than the top holder I am using. 2001 Volvo V70 T5 bottom cup holders aren't good fit additionally, due to the shifting stick being difficult to access/operate if Weathertech car phone holder in use. It rocks but works in top cup holder that comes out from dash...just not the "good fit" I expected.
