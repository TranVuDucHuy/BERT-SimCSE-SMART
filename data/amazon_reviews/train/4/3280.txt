This monitor is great. It's simple to use, lightweight, user friendly and affordable. If you're expecting groundbreaking and amazing results then you're not being realistic. This is a simple monitor for beginners or professionals alike as long as they are looking for a simple monitor. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because you can't hear the audio during playback (at least in my experience. Then again I barely got it) so I will keep messing with it to see what this can really do. Overall I am very happy.
