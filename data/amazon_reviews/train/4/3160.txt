Sometimes these SD cards come corrupt as new cards. So don’t use it for professional shoot straight away. I had some issues with this card and I don’t trust it completely, but most of the time it works great and I trust it enough to use for secondary cameras or backup cameras. As far as durability goes, very strong and premium feeling. This thing will not break and I like that about it.
