i got 2 of these cameras an love them. Over the years i have had several systems but this is my favorite.I like that the phone app notifies me when motion is detected allowing me to watch the live video stream.Motion detection sensitivity is adjustable thru the phone app. all in all i like the phone app. i have had some detections that showed nothing on the camera an thing it is due to the sensor detection area is larger than the camera view. i also noticed that the motion detection has a problem detecting someone walking twards the camera as opposedd to moving from side to side. but moving the camera to a differant location fixed that. i wish the motion detection area was adjustable or even use zones. one other issuse is the relation ship on the rear mounted mount an the wifi antenia. you can adjust the camera 90 degrees to the left but the swing to the right is restricted to the right due to the antenia hitting the camera mount.i tempararily put in my attic because of a racoon problem. The battery lasted over a week before needing recharged. the coons were eating the bait but not setting the traps. i was able to see with the camera they were reaching thru the sides of the trap to get the food without even going in. this knowledge lead me to put smaller screen wire on the sides of the trap an caught that very night.Easy setup with good performance - i can highly recommend this camera.
