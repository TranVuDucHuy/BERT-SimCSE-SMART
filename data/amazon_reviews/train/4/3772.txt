The camera seems to work great and easy to connect. I used an sd card so I wouldn’t have to get a subscription. The camera seems to stop recording to the sd card and I cannot seem to get it to work. The is the second camera this happened to and is very frustrating. The first one I just bought another sd card which seemed to solve the problem but I really don’t believe the card went bad and it had plenty of storage left, I even erased everything. So now I don’t know if I should replace this sd card too.
