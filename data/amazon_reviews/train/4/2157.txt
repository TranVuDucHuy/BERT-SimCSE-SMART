So far I have been very happy with this mic.I am running it on a GoPro with media mod.I have had multiple of the shock mounts break while mounting the mic (especially in colder weather 35-45 F).Their customer service has been excellent.You get to speak to a freindly person in the US and they ship a replacement out right away under warranty.This quality of customer service is rare these days; especially for a product at this price point.I will order more products from this company knowing the quality of customer service.
