We received a Brother Wi-Fi AirPrint printer a few years ago from my sister-in-law and it works great with iPads and other Apple products. You just have to make sure if you have four Wi-Fi signals coming from your router, you’re on the same network as the printer.We have had other printers like Epson and Hewlett-Packard, but this brother printer is the first one we’ve had that’s Wi-Fi. It’s very easy to use with our IPads.My only issue with the Brother printer is that we don’t print as much as we use to and the prices of the cartridges are more expensive than the other printers we have owned. I buy the extra capacity type and they don’t seem to last any longer than the regular capacity cartridges. My sister-in-law has the exact same printer and uses it daily and she’s always buying ink cartridges for hers as well.It’s a great printer and easy to use, but the ink cartridges are not as cheap as our other printers. When we got these, there wasn’t a lot of these Wi-Fi printers on the market yet. We also got a good deal as she purchased a new All In One computer and the printers were part of the deal she made with the salesperson. So we got ours for a Christmas present.These are cheaper here than other places that I’ve purchased the cartridges from in the past. I’ve paid as much as $70.00 for the complete set of four in the past.
