Amazing difference in picture. One of the fans on the HD30 stopped working so I opted to replace v repair and thankful I did. It only took 10 minutes to swap them out. My ceiling mount system worked fine one I was able to find screws that worked. The new unit uses bigger screws than the previous one and did not come with them. I fortunately had a set of screws that fit. They should have included them. The new unit is totally quiet with no fan noise. It boots up and shuts down in mere seconds and provides a great Hi Def picture
