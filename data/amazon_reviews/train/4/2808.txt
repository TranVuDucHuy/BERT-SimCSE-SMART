I've used tiles since their inception around a decade ago. I'll get into my views on tiles in a sec but if you are familiar with tile and like it this is a good value. I paid $60.Tiles were around long before airtags or anything else of the sort. They work through Bluetooth. It's a crowdsourced location service. This means only people with bluetooth and location turned on and the tile app installed can help you find your device and only when they are in bluetooth range. If you are tracking luggage or anything else that could be far away from you I'd pay more for a different type of tech.For me I have ADHD and lose my things constantly in my apartment. This is perfect for me because I can ask my Alexa to ring my keys, id badge, wallet, phone, whatever. I use it many times each day to locate things in my apartment. If this is the kind of use you anticipate I strongly encourage you to buy these.I took away a star because Tile has a feature to notify you when you leave something behind... and you have to buy a premium subscription to use it. That's really annoying. I already bought the tech. Don't paywall basic utilitarian features.
