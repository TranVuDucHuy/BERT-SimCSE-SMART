A decent starter telescope, but, as others have said, the tripod is a piece of junk, and the spotter scope is diffiult to use. We went up to Joshua Tree Nat'l Park to see the "new" comet and even with the tripod on the hood of the car, using the telescope required crouching almost onto one's knees. Very wobbly and hard to keep trained, esp. when one's fingers are freezing cold! Also, the fasteners for the tripod legs almost guarantee that you'll pinch your finger at least once every time you extend a leg. To use the telescope at all, even if you have a low chair it'll crick your back. Sadly, I'm betting many beginners will become so frustrated they'll give up and return the whole thing. Get a decent tripod, one you can stand up to use, or even sit comfortably in a normal camp chair. The telescope DOES give a good look at stars/planets however. The instructions should also tell you which of the eye pieces you should use, depending on what you're looking at. As it is, this may be best used for peering into neighbors' windows. No, don't be a creeper. Don't do that.
