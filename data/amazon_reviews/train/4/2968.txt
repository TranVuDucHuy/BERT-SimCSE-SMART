The first one died in about 2-3 months, the second's microphone isn't working anymore but the sounds quality is still better. I wouldn't recommend the sony akg's as that is too trebelly, but the audio on these have been pretty balanced and lovely. Its pretty comfortable unless you're wearing them literally 24/7 (which I do). Cheap enough, much more reliable and sound much nicer than dollar store crap without gambling with too much money. Better than some of the ones that sell for $20 on here.
