Install was simple, video quality is great, and it comes with a lot of helpful customizable features. Only critique is that the time delay between the camera detecting motion and the notification being sent to my phone is significant, up to 10 seconds sometimes. If it were a trespasser or animal, the time it would take me to see the notification, navigate to the app, and connect to the microphone to scare off the animal or speak to the person would take about 30-60 seconds depending on connection. One other critique is you only have the option to stop recording once motion has no longer been detected, or to record for a fixed amount of time once movement is detected. I think it would be beneficial to have a setting in which the camera records during motion detection AND set a fixed amount of time to continue recording after motion has stopped. I think 4/5 stars is appropriate and I would recommend to a friend.
