Enjoy taking these with me everywhere, as the case easily fits in any pocket. The earbuds sit well in my ear, and provide great volume; turning earbud volume on high and phone volume on high hurts, usually have both about half. A little on the touch sensitive side, as earbuds often pause or skip music, even if that's not what I intended. These earbuds have a noise canceling function, but that's not the primary design (suggest getting something else, if that's your primary reason). Battery life is excellent for their size; used continually for almost 5 hours (noise canceling function off). Case will completely recharge earbuds twice, without being plugged in. The only complaint is that I have to constantly adjust the earbuds if I'm doing rigorous exercise or work; they've fallen out during runs. This is a good purchase for me, as I don't mind having a general purpose set of earbuds, and a few other headphones for specific situations.
