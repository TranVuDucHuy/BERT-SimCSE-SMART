I have about 150 hours of tapes I want to convert, so I wanted to make sure I got the best video converter I could find with a reasonable cost.After I bought this and set it up I thought the quality was a bit lacking so I then went and bought elGato based on a popular YouTube review. When I tried out the elGato converter it was WORSE. (see side by side frame grabs).I then played back from my tape directly to the TV and realized that the Roxio converted file was about the same as what was played directly from tape to TV - we are just used to HD now.If you look at the frame grabs, in particular look at the grass and the sky. Detail with the elGato is very lacking.Things you need to know:1) Converted old VHS tape video quality is lacking overall, we have been very spoiled with digital HD and 4K, you will most likely be disappointed, but hey, these are your MEMORIES so it is better then not converting your tapes.2) VHS tape degrades over time DO NOT WAIT ANY LONGER TO CONVERT YOUR TAPES!3) Get a good machine to play your tapes back on, the best you can get ahold of anyway. CLEAN THE HEADS before you start, and if doing a lot of tapes, clean the head frequently.Roxio Pro's:1) Less expensive than other popular "higher end" converters2) Ez install and set up (6 year old PC running Windows 10)3) Better video quality than elGato - quality is about the same as playing direct from tape to TVRoxio Con's:1) I just paid $39, now it's $69???2) Only audio adjustments when capturing (no contrast/saturation etc)_________________________________________________________________________________ElGato Pro's:1) Ez install and set up (6 year old PC running Windows 10)2) Pre-recording video and audio adjustments (contrast, saturation, volume etc.)ElGato Con's:1) Pretty pricey for what other converters will do2) QUALITY - that is the whole deal right there. VHS conversion is poor anyway, and this converter will make it even worse.Other info: The elGato converts to MP4, much higher compression than the MPG of Roxio. Check out the file sizes, bit rates etc, noticeable difference and as far as file size. (these are still tiny compared to 1080p HD - no reason to use a bunch of compression and lose detail).I'd give it another star if they added more pre-recording controls (contrast, hue, saturation etc)Hope this helps!
