The kit is easy to use right out of the box. The storage case in nice. It will hold my phone horizontal, it will not hold vertically.The only nits I have with the kit is that you need Social Media account to register for the warranty. I do not want to be on that platform, so there should be an option for just registering online.It will not support my 12 Pro on the stand pointed down as if I were working on a project. I get the hand held tripod is probably too small for that. It is not a major deal.I shot a test video and the light and sound quality for an indoor video were better than if I just used my phone.
