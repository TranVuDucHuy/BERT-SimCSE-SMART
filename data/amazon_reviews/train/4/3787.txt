I wasn't expecting much, but the picture quality is pretty good. The materials of the camera feel cheap compared to a GoPro, but then again you are not paying the price of a Go Pro. Probably best for casual users. The camera comes with a bunch of attachments, most of which seem pretty worthless and unnecessary.
