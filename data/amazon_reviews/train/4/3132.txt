I have been sick so haven’t used this camera besides a few photos here and there. Tonight was very important for my son and I… after 4 packages of film (inserted correctly) I have 3 pictures that came out ok. It’s big and bulky but nostalgic yet I looked like a fool taking and replacing film while I was trying to take a pic of my 6 yr old with his favorite piano player! The film is expensive as well as the camera so not worth what we got! All white pics
