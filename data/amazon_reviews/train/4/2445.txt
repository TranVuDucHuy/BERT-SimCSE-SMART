This is a fantastic projector for the price. The picture is bright even in a dimly lit room. The only issue I have with the image is that it starts to blur toward the edges of the frame. This picture is best viewed when the projector is pointing directly at the surface it’s projecting on. The projector does adjust for skew but this is where you run into the problem of blurriness once you make the screen square again. It’s not a MAJOR blur but could make you go -_- a little if a character moves out of center screen. This issue is, in my opinion, nothing major and doesn’t effect the overall image. Once you get the focusing right, it’s awesome.Now, don’t let the pictures fool you. One of the Images used shows a screen with Netflix other streaming services leading consumers to believe this projector has apps. This projector DOES NOT come with any preinstalled apps or the ability to download any streaming apps. You will have to plug another device into this projector to use it. It was a bit disappointing when I got it and discovered that. However, I have an Apple TV box that I can watch stuff on so, it’s not a terrible inconvenience for myself but could be for someone else. My recommendation is that the seller remove the image showing the projectors ability to support streaming services as it borders on false advertising.Aside from that, if you’re wanting a great little projector without all the hullabaloo to watch movies with the fam, game all night or in an ever-boring office meeting, this is a fantastic option. Very simple to set up and has a very large and very bright image that’s crisp and clean.
