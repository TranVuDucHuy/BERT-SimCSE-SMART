I love the Kasa products and the ability to have control when I'm away and to also set schedules for the lighting. I take away one star because every now and then the products seem to lose contact with the app. At first, I thought it was a wifi issue but when I unplug and replug the outlet or bulb, it re-establishes contact with the app immediately. I also tried refreshing from within the app but that doesn't help. I put some of these plugs and bulbs in hard to reach places for the ease of use but if I have to reach the plug then there is no point. It doesn't bother me too much since it doesn't happen that often but it does happen.
