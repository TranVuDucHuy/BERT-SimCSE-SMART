I bought this so I could keep an eye on my puppy when I leave and do not regret it. I can speak to him through the microphone and can move it to see where he is in my room. Amazing!Update: I have had the camera for a while now and it has done super well. One of my complaints is that it is very hard to switch the wifi it connects to once you set it up. You have to take the back panel off and reset it manually. There isn't an option through the app. Very Disappointing.However to keep in one place it was a very good camera for the price.
