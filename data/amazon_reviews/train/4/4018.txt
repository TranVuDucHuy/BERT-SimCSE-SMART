You are definitely paying for the R&D for the app in the cost of this scope. That being said I think it is great for people just getting in to or returning to the hobby. I picked up this scope to get back into the swing of things after about 20 years away from the hobby. The app does an amazing job of finding things the first time, every time. I've been using the scope for a few weeks now and the app hasn't failed me once.The scope is good, not great. At 102mm it gives you enough light for visual astronomy of the planets, clusters and brighter DSO's. One of the big pluses is that the refractor design is maintenance free, no collimation required here. The focuser on mine is a bit gritty and can be hard to get focused when you're really trying to dial in the sharpness. The eyepieces are typical of what you will see in low cost scopes, I upgraded to Celestron X-Cel eyepieces and it was an AMAZING difference.Now for the mount, oh lord the mount.... The base of the tripod is, again, typical of a low cost scope, provides enough stability to get the job done. The single fork design is both the best and worst part of the mount. It is made out of amazingly cheap plastic, the movement and slow motion controls are friction based and tend to be either too tight or too loose, finding the sweet spot has thus far eluded me. The scope shakes badly after focusing or movement and you will have to wait a few seconds for things to calm down. But also on this fork mount is the phone holder/mirror that makes the StarSense app work, and boy oh boy does it work.Celestron also makes these in reflector and dobsonion designs, so whatever your viewing preference they will have you covered, remember you are paying for the app, not the quality of the equipment.So for a beginner or returning hobbyist I think this is a great jumping off point and a gateway into bigger and better scopes down the line. Grab this scope, upgrade those eyepieces, download that app and have hours and hours of fun. I would like to see Celestron come out with a universal StarSense phone mount and then allow you to pay for the app, I would love to have this on my dob, maybe some day.Happy stargazing!!
