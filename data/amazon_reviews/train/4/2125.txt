All in all, this was a solid purchase. They are surprisingly comfortable despite sitting in the ear, which has always been my challenge with earbuds - usually using them irritates my inner ear, but these do not. My only complaint is that I wish there was an adjustable cincher where the cables split, so that I can adjust the length of the gap - a basic feature on most earbuds, so strangely absent here.
