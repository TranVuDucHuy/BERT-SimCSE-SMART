I love Polaroids. I decided to buy the latest model as I was still using the Instax Mini 8 before. I don't really have complaints about the product itself rather that I ordered the Polaroid in blush pink and received a black one. I'm still going it keep it because a Polaroid camera is still a Polaroid camera but I don't understand how this happened.
