Sound quality is much better than the built in mic on my camcorder. I tested the movo against the camcorder, and regardless of the settings incl “user volume “ and NR, the Movo did a better job. I ran a podcast next to my camcorder to simulate an audience around me, and was able to hear my voice better at all distances I tested , from just in front to 30’ away.Update: sound volume for a ballet performance was very good, although audience noises were also picked up. The 1 issue I have with the mic is that the included bag is not useful - the pleather started degrading after the 1st use and putting dust everywhere in the videocam case, so I just threw it away.
