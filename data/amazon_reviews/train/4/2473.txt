Picture is crystal clear, I wanted this so I can keep an eye on my inlaw with dementia when she is sleeping. I noticed it would trigger human response with her tv on. So i moved camera so it would not be in view of TV. So anyways it says human movement detected but 100% nothing moving. The only way to watch play back is to sign up for a subscription. The cost is monthly or yearly not a lot of money. But not sure that its worth to watch playback when it is recording nothing. It does detect actual movement. Not sure its worth the subscription.
