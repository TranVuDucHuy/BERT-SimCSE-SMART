I was a little nervous because of other reviews but decided to take a chance anyway. I’m glad I did! The majority of the picture came out great! I will say if you take any inside picture to make sure it’s a well lit room and use flash. Otherwise all you’ll see it a black figure of a picture. But I overall loved them! Brought back good memories and had that camera film look! Also remember these are “old” cameras don’t expect smart phone quality
