I wanted some LED lights to use for home photo and video projects to compliment the lighting or to use is low light scenarios.I love the options to dim or brighten the lights if needed. The multiple color filters were one of the main features of why I purchased it and they came in handy. You basically get a set for each light included.They are so lightweight that I can just carry all three lights along with my tripod. The instructions are fairly simple and I didn't have any issues setting everything.These lights won't be as bright as the traditional softbox and they won't extend that high either. These aren't going to brighten up the set of a Hollywood studio but they will compliment the lighting in a small setting, office, or bedroom. You will also need a USB block to plug the lights into because they only come with a USB cord. Please take note before buying.
