Product works as intended. Fill the bottle up with your favorite screen solution and wipe away with the felt. Giving product 4/5 because the lid that holds the utensils is too loose and can be easily knocked off. This would not be a problem if utensils fit snuggly into storage slots, but this is not the case. I find myself having to carefully hold down the lid when using it to wipe off screen solution.
