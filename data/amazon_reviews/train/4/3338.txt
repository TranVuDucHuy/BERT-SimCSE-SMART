I had to come up with a novel solution for the three 5x7 ft Mylar photo backdrops I have in a recording studio with 10 ft ceilings. It involved a lot of measurements (double-and triple-checking) for correct placement of brackets. I used 10ft x 2” PVC and cut down to size. No midpoint sag at all.Didn’t take long at all to install. Wish the plastic chain was a bit more heavy duty, though. Diagrams are small and difficult to read but it’s pretty much common sense how to install.
