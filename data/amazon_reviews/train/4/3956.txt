I enjoy all new tech and concepts. This is a cool one for those who owned/ own a projector.I heard about this in January 2022 and thought is was too expensive at $899. Then this past month, the price went down to $699. That seemed more reasonable.I enjoy this device and it's smart features. It basically projects the Samsung Smart TV platform on any surface.I project it on my orange wall in the kitchen with a good amount of light present. The brightness and picture is decent.It auto focuses and auto keystones to your set up. It has Alexa and can act as an Echo device for the projector. It has all the apps my Samsung Smart TV has with other fun picture and background art/ features.The best thing about this projector is the quick cool down process. You can turn it off and it'll be ready to put away in minutes.The issues with this device are the auto keystone and auto focus. They are not that accurate for a smart device with auto tracking sensors built in it. Also, I wish it was brighter in the daylight. Maybe the next model will have these issues worked out.
