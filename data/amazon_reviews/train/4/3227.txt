These filters are great, very well made, But I would have liked it even more if the mini 3 pro lens cover would fit inside the case the filters comes in, really weird they didn't include a place to put the original lens cover, it will for sure get lost sometime...Additionally, the ND4 and ND8 filters are pretty much useless, would rather have ND128 and ND256 instead.
