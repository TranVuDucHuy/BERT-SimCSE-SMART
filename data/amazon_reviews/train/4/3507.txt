For the price, these are an exceptional value. They are not completely noise cancelling but I don't really want that anyhow - prefer to be somewhat aurally aware of my surroundings. The sound quality is very good to my ear - at my age paying a lot for frequencies that I can't hear makes very little sense! I have not been able to figure out how to get the assistant feature to work yet (using it with a Google Pixel 5a phone) and switching forward and back between tracks does not always work as expected but that may just be inexperience with the tap control system. For the price, this is an excellent buy.
