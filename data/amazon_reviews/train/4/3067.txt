I wasn't sure if I would use a drone after the first few days off newness and my husband said he would buy this for me and if i really got good at it, he'd but me a DJ mini. He had talked me out of the mini. This is a lot of fun and price is great! I'm so afraid i will lose it but it's easy to land of you start to get haywire. Best to make sure you stay off with it level and synch it at every start. It's a little tough in the wind but we live near the water. It's very cool to look at your own home and i think it's an excellent value to get used to a drone. I'm not sure I will step up to the DJ and the expense when this does the truck. Practice makes perfect! My husband uses it more than i do! I've been keeping it in the car and taking it with me where ever i go! You might want to put a spot of super glue on the control knobs. I knocked one off in tall grass and it took forever to find. Also, put the foam protectors on when booty on part and in the case.
