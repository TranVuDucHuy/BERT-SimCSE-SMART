This is a nice, simple digital photo frame using both USB flash and SD/SDHC drives. Works as advertised. Some notes:1. You will have to pre-orient the photos the way you want them to appear before you place them on your drive. The frame has no software to look at the EXIF metadata auto-rotate the picture depending on whether you want to use the frame in portrait mode vs landscape mode. Also - make sure use MS-DOS FAT with MBR partitioning for your drive.2. Sadly the included power cord uses a straight jack into the frame (see pic). It protrudes beyond the frame. This prevents using the frame in portrait mode with power cord at the bottom as it will not be stable, and when used as shown, the cord is seen. No, the cord does not flex enough to hide it. Aluratek committed a design error with this. They should have substituted an angled connector for the straight one on the power cord.
