These earbuds come with a enough different ear-cushions that you are pretty much guaranteed to find a set that is adequately comfortable. The cord is sturdy and I haven't found it ever trying to tangle the way many other cheap quality earbuds do so I can attest to the title of the product being "Tangle-Free." Overall I am happy with my purchase. The sound quality is reasonable and with the right cushions, most noise around me is well muted. I have found that long-term use leaves my ears sore and I can only guess it is the sharper shaped barrel edges of the bud itself resting on my ears during extended use. So typically, I use these for a few hours and then give my ears a break for a few hours. It works, but if I need to be in true noise cancelation mode -- these are set aside for my over-the-ear Bose headset, just can't beat them for noise-cancelation.
