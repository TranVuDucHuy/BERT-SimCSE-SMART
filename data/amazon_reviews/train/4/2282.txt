I got this pen to use with my Surface Pro 8, to replace my broken pen on the cheap.The pen itself is nice and thin. The button COULD be in a bad place depending on how you hold a pencil. It works immediately, however, and doesn't need any fancy setup.My problem I have been having is that when I try to draw a line, it cuts out, leaving gaps in the line.I charged it fully, and changed the tip, but the issue persists.The pen seems nice overall, but it may be better for note taking vs art.
