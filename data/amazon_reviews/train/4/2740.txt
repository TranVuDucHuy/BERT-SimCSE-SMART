This is my first wireless charger. The charging stand is compatible with my iPhone 14 and it charges my phone quickly and efficiently. The design is sleek and modern, it looks great on my desk and it takes up minimal space. The 3 in 1 feature is also a great feature, as I can charge my iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. The charging stand is also very stable, it holds my devices securely and prevents them from falling off. The price is reasonable for the performance and quality of the product.
