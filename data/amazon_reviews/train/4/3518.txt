Been using for ~1 month and its been great so far. Very clear sounding even when only connected through USB.Came with an XLR cable, little mic stand, and a pop filter which are all super convenient, and good value for the sale price I got it at.It's a dynamic microphone so having it close to your mouth is ideal.
