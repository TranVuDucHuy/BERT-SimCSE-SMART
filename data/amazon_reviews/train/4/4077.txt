These headphones aren't a ripoff of anything but there's a couple of things that bug me about them. I had an issue where one side unpaired and it took me almost half an hour to pair it correctly again. They're a little bit big and clunky and everything from putting them back into their case to putting them in my ear feels a little awkward compared to my previous headphones which were the skull candy dimes. The good thing about these headphones is the sound quality is great (in my unprofessional opinion) and they have a built in charging cable which is super convenient. I'm not fond of the touch control, I prefer having an actual button that clicks when you press it but that's just a personal preference. I also feel like the 3 mode sound equalizer isn't something I'd really use and only complicates the use of these headphones. I don't do bass bost and all that stuff, I just pick the best setting and leave it on that. Sometimes when I'm trying to forward a song it switches the sound mode because I accidentally tapped it one too many times so that can get a little annoying. All in all these aren't bad headphones for the price but they're not my favorites either.
