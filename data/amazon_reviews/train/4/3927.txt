There’s lots of better ones I’m not saying it’s bad it’s work perfect for a beginner or a pro so I recommend getting this the only problem is getting away and closer to the eyepiece. If you put the eyepiece in and don’t see anything then that’s probably why it’s not close or far enough but overall it’s fine.
