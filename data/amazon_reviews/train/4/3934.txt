Got this for a family member for Christmas. Went through set-up process and it would connect to the Wi-Fi but would never give me an access code or QR code to complete setup. Tried to do a factory reset but still wouldn’t work. Tried to use the app to see if that was the problem and it wouldn’t work either. Buy something else other than this piece of garbage.UPDATE: After leaving a. 1-star review, the company reached out to me to inform me that it was a server error on their end that led to the frame not working. We have tried it again and it seems to work as advertised. I am upgrading my rating to a 4-star. If it weren't for the network issues on Christmas Day and having to take back the gift that was bought for family due to thinking it didn't work, my rating may be a 5.
