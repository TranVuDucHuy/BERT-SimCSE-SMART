Let's just say this product is interesting. I have been experimenting with it to determine if it actually does what it says and I'm a little on the fence about that. First of all, it consistently beeps even though nothing is present. It did put up on a camera that was intentionally placed in a location near my computer. I will take it with me on a couple of trips that I'm taking in a few months and use it to scan the hotel rooms. I will them come back and write another review to let you know if it detected anything.
