I’d have given this 5 stars if it hadn’t been such a pain in the butt to set up- I got stuck when connecting the camera to Wi-Fi and it took a couple hours, several times and a few google searches to figure it out, even though I’m pretty ok with technology.Yes, it’s buggy - the camera says it can’t rotate anymore when I know it can, it goes left sometimes when I want it to point up, there’s a lag. But is has like 70% of the features of similarly products that are 3-5x its price. I can point the camera, I can usually talk through it, and I can stream it from my phone, that’s pretty good for me!Overall I’d recommend it to others.
