I recently bought this gift for my Fiance for Christmas and after having used it myself I have fallen in love with this Instafilm camera.First off, I think it is important to know and list what your expectations are before purchasing this product. This camera is not intended to replace a digital camera as the quality of the prints is lacking compared to what you would shoot with a quality DSLR or an Iphone camera. However, that is exactly why we purchased this specific camera. It is the uniqueness of each individual print and the imperfections that create a moment in time. If you are looking for unique photos that are a tangible memory of an event then this is the camera for you. Moving on.This camera is super simple and easy to use. I would say the hardest thing is getting a hang of the brightness setting and judging by your environment when to make it a little darker or when to make it lighter. We have found that if shooting outside it is best to set the darkness setting down one, or everything is a little washed out.Pros:-Unique picture with it's own imperfections-Simpe and easy to use-Sturdy designCons:-Does not come with a timer featureOverall, this camera is fun to use in addition to a phone camera or a DSLR, but cannot replace it. We often take our camera on short hikes and adventures and will usually only take 1-2 photos of the trip and then take the rest of our pictures on our other cameras. If you are looking for something that will make fun memories then this camera fits the bill and will last you a fairly long time.
