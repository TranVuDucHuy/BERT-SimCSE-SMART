After months of back and forth looking at larger beginner dobsonians, weighing the StarSense app, waiting for a sale on the StarSense dob, I finally saw the DX 102AZ refractor go back on sale on Amazon, and went for it. Hindsight: I wouldn’t have had the storage space for a 10” dobsonian scope anyway, and the portability of this scope will make me want to use it more!Setup was easy. Downloading the StarSense app was simple, mounting and aligning the scope, red dot, and StarSense during the day was a breeze. This evening was overcast but clear dark sky told me I’d have an hour where seeing would improve so I brought it out and started viewing. God I missed this. I haven’t had a telescope since I was a young teenager and there’s just something so nostalgic and calming about sitting back and looking over the craters on the moon. The entire hour was over before I knew it. I’ve attached a low magnification image and a high magnification image just captured through my smartphone because, somehow, no one has posted any images of captures from this scope. Very happy with my purchase, and can’t wait to find some clear dark sky to really test what StarSense can do!4 stars because I replaced the lenses and diagonal as soon as I held them (plastic pieces that didn’t feel substantial) and even at this price it would be nice to have fine focus adjustment, but other than that for the price I’m very happy.
