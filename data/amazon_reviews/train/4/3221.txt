The backdrop was delivered folded and wrapped in plastic, so it had to be ironed right off the bat. Ironing was about 80% effective. I clipped the sides of the fabric to the backdrop stands to smooth the wrinkles that didn’t come out with ironing. The backdrop is thick enough to not be see-thru which was a great relief. You never know with inexpensive purchases. The fabric is smooth on one side and fuzzy on the other. (I ironed the smooth side.) I haven’t taken it down since it’s been hung, so I can’t speak to the wrinkle-free aspects; but for the money, I’m not disappointed at all. Maybe low expectations helped. It worked great for what I intended to use it for, and the price was right.
