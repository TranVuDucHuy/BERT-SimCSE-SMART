This is the perfect size for my Sony Aiv with a 70-200 mm and an extra lens. However the side pocket should really have been an elastic one instead of just a flap of fabric. Since it is not a try side pocket if you stick an umbrella or anything in there it takes up space inward also meaning I don't have room on the inside for a second lens if I have anything in the side pocket. Disappointing for an otherwise ideal bag.
