Been using this the past goose hunting season, as my spoting scope, and it came in very handy, I spotted groundhogs 800 yards away, but the cellphone holder is absolute rubbish, the clarity of the optics is ok for the price range, it's lightweight, I take this thing everywhere I go, I would buy again for sure, and if it gets damaged it won't break my heart nor my piggy bank
