I've had my headphones for over 2 weeks now. I really love the color and the comfort. The 90Â° turn of the ears is very good because it allows me to comfortably but the headphones around my neck without worrying if theyll get damaged. The design is smooth and the extension is perfect. The Active noise canceling hasn't made a huge impression but it does make a difference. I'm my experience, it's more like controlled white noise that makes the sound a little quieted and focused in one spot. It's like the sound is less surrounded while ANC is on, so i dont believe theres a microphone allowing you to hear what's around you. I still use and really like the feature. These headphones come with an aux cord that allows you to use the headphones without Bluetooth which is also good and allows versatility. The pairing is EXTREMELY fast with a previously paired device once the headphones turn on. The battery life is really good and long lasting as well. Overall, this is a great gift and easy to take care of.
