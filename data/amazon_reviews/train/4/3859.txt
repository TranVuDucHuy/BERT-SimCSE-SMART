We live on a ranch and I use these for surveillance and to just observe the mountains and general area so my use is long range. My normal viewing distance is between 300yd (my gate) and 10000yd (the peak of a mountain I watch). The binoculars aren't bad but they aren't as clear as my 20x50 rifle scope which should be comparable.My complaint is that the focal center wheel is the only thing that holds the eyepiece to the binocular which allows the eyepiece to "walk" side to side after adjustment since it's loose. After I focus in and I'm scanning a target the image gets blurry because holding it to my eyes causes the eyepiece to walk out of adjustment and I have to hold it in place with my thumb and index fingers. So I returned them.If you need something very simple for close range then this *may* work but it's pretty annoying having to constantly mess with them.Update: This company contacted me and were very nice and wanted to make this right. They immediately sent out another pair of binoculars and followed up with me several times to make sure I knew the status of the replacement, etc.The eyepiece was still loose on the replacement BUT I after watching a couple YouTube videos I realized it was VERY EASY to pop off the cover where the screw is that holds the eyepiece on the unit. It was very loose, I simply tightened it down and replaced the cover. The unit works perfectly now.I changed my 2 star review to a 4. I did this because even though the replacement still had this issue this company showed some of the best customer service I've ever received on Amazon. The company RONHAN is a 5 star company but the loose screws costs a star.
