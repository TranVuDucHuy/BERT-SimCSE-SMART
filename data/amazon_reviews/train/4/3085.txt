For the price I think the V3 is a good camera. The night vision is awesome! I do wish that the video resolution would be a little more clear when zooming in tho.So the bads:1. Poor wifi range. Known issue2. Motion detection is too sensitive. I have a few of the V3 and they are a hit or miss in my opinion. Some alert over a leaf blowing across the yard. And many times it will alert when the wind is blowing or at night the glare of a cars headlight or tail lights reflecting of the fence.3. Lag with viewing back recorded footage on the SD car. Not sure if it's the app, but all my Wyze Cam V3 has this issue. When viewing back a video the playback would stop and freeze. I would have to back out and reconnect the camera and repeat this process many times. Not really fun of your using this as a security camera purpose. It's more for viewing live footage around the house to see what's going on.The Wyze Cam is compatible with Alexa. I like the fact that I cam tell Alexa to view a certain camera around my house. The only thing I hate is the delay it takes to open the live view on Alexa. I am pretty sure with the previous gen camera the live view would show much quicker, but with the V3 I would take a few seconds to even like 15 seconds later before I can see anything. Not cool of your trying to see who's on your yard with a notification alert goes off. I also like the person detection on Alexa. I think the best selling point for me. Now I know if there's someone around my house that is not suppose to be there.
