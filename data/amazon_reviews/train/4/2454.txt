So I had to review these because they are worth the money and work fine but they do have some cons. I've had them installed for about 3 months both in and outdoors.The pros:-You definitely get what you pay for, but they are getting the job done for the most.-The picture quality is pretty good both day and night. Night time, it turns to black and white but in the light or daytime, the picture is in color.-The audio is great.-They are purposed for indoor use, I believe, however i have 2 installed outdoor and they have withstood light drizzle and frost.-They are lightweight and I used stick strips to hold them onto the walls and they have yet to fall even the 2 outdoors (I live in an apartment).-I think you can connect up to 6 at a time but it may be more, I can't find the manual at the moment and I dont see any info in the settings on the app.-You can watch all views on the screen, they show up like thumbnails and it has an option to select a specific screen by tapping that screen twice, then you can switch back to multi view screens if needed.-The LA View app was easy to connect and they connect easy to the wifi.-They have a really good zoom feature on the screen, just enlarge the view to zoom.-The microphone is muffled a bit but you can make out whats being said if you listen closely, its no 2 way talking, so if you speak through the phone the other person can hear you but you cannot hear them unless you release the mic.-The audio feature also only streams the audio for whatever view/screen you're on.The cons:-They do not record continuously, I believe the longest recording I had was 2 hours and that sucks because I wanted to be able to record at all times if need be.-The also do not record multiple views/screens, so you can only record 1 view at a time which also sucks.-They often update or require an update and its random.-There is about a 3-5 second delay in the view, so its not really real time but kinda is.-The play back feature is useless if you don't record that view/screen, not sure why its there.-The cameras only adjust up and down, not left to right and you can rotate the camera itself to make the picture sideways if need be.Overall, they get the job done and add a sense of protection for me. I love being able to watch my place while I'm away. This is my first time purchasing video surveillance equipment, so I'm now understanding that I will need to spend more money if I want a better quality system. I plan to purchase 4 more so that I can install 8 of them into a property I just purchased. I wont be in the same state as my property so I need surveillance.
