This projector kept coming up in various YouTube video reviews for budget projectors. I was not expecting incredible performance from one costing $79 but I have to admit, I am really impressed with the brightness and clarity of it. The sound is pretty decent, but can be a little tinny. It's not bad, but I just bought some computer speakers to improve the quality. I have the projector about 10 feet from a large white wall and we love watching netflix/disney+ on it (via Roku or computer). Can you watch it in daylight...eh, probably - but it wouldn't be enjoyable. But with the lights off/at night - truly impressive. A feature I love which doesn't seem to be highlighted is the ability to "zoom" (+/-) the picture in and out. Helpful for adjusting the final size on a wall based on distance without moving the unit.
