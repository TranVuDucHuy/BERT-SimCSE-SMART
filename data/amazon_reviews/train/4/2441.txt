I did lots of research in the DIY market and found ARLO to be the best. I found the product to be excellent. Setup was easy (once I turned off my VPN) and the quality is very good.But, I bought just as they released a new app. This raised some issues, and the documentation on the new app is sparse.I was trying to do something very simple and basic. This required many calls to Customer Support and I was given bad advise 3 times. I finally got through to Level 2 Support, and while he didn’t resolve the issue, he showed me something new that allowed me to figure it out myself.What I liked about Customer Service was they always answer right away and they are all very nice. However, I don’t see where they’ve been sufficiently trained in the new app.If ARLO upgrades the documentation, and trains their folks, this product gets 5-Stars.
