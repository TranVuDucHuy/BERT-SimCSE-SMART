I was looking for a instant camera and came across this one. The price was good and I’d get my picture instantly. The only issue I had was since it’s small I have to watch how I hold it or I’ll cover the lens, also the button for taking the pictures never stays on( good thing it came with 2). The pictures it takes are very small but good for my needs for now.
