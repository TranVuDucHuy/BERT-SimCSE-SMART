The good:These were better than I was expecting at their $15 price point (at the time of purchase Jan, 2023). The bass is real punchy and the noise isolation (these are not active noise cancelling) is solid.The bad:The bass over powers everything else though and distorts the sound. But for the price the sound quality can be skipped over.The bottom line:If you need a cheap pair of headphones to block out some sound or plug into your laptop for a work call (no mic on the headphones so just use your laptop mic), these are a solid option.
