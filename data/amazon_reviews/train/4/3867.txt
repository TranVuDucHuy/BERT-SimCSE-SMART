As a former semi-professional photographer, I was looking for a compact camera to use for daily/family life and the occasional photo/video project, so I could get rid of my clunky pro gear (Canon 5d Mark ii). Obviously it's not full frame, so there is a slight compromise in the look/depth of images, but in general this camera produces amazing results. It's actually better in low light than the 5d Mark ii (which is now a few generations old). My only two qualms are: 1.) Lack is in-body IS. It's pretty difficult to take steady video without a gimbal or tripod, and 2.) Poor battery life. I highly recommend buying multiple batteries, and always having a backup charged! Overall, I'd HIGHLY recommend this camera!
