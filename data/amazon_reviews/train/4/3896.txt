Can’t beat them for the price. Only complaint is Audio recording quality is very very poor as is the two way talk feature but the video is a solid 1080p even at 2k. You cannot beat these for the price. The app works well and it’s nice having local storage instead of paying monthly for cloud crap. Wi-Fi works well on them and they are dead simple to setup. 4/5. Great value.
