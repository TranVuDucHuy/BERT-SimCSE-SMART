All of this is right in the manual, but be advised that you need a particular type of box to plug this into (the higher output one) and placing your phone on the pad needs to be done carefully or it won't start charging.Other than that this was great. My phone plug was starting to wear out, so a charge that doesn't have to plug into my phone was really helpful.
