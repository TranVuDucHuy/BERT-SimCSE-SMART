I think the ink is expensive and I don’t get anywhere near recommended sheet amount. I know a lot of that has to do with the printer, but I have been on the phone with brother multiple times since I bought printer and they claim it’s not the printer. I keep the ink settings on the lowest quality and max out at 3/4 recommended sheets it can print before having to replace the colors. And most of the stuff I print has limited color to it.
