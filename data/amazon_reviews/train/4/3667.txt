I got these because the OEM tips wouldn't stay in reliably. These seems to be a little better than OEM, but not by much. I think the low end frequencies sound better as the foam probably provides a better seal. I'm a big guy, but I found the OEM smalls stayed in the best. For these, I'm using the mediums.
