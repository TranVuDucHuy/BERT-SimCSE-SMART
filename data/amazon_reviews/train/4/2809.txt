I had dropped my wallet and spent hours trying to find it. It fell behind couch. So, I thought I would get one of these to put in my wallet. I have not had to use yet, but in setting it up and testing, I find the volume is not loud. I worry if I did lose my wallet again, I would not be able to hear the tone. I tried changing the tones to see if one was louder than the other. No, they are all about the same.The setup of this tractor is easy. I have an android and that is why I selected this tracker.
