I've been using pixel phones exclusively since the first edition. This phone is very close to being my favorite one but also very far at the same time. The fingerprint sensor is awful despite all the software updates out of the box. Thats the one huge flaw with pixel 7. Hopefully it gets fixed one of these days.Other than the fingerprint sensor, there's many, many good things to say about this phone. I won't write too much here. Just check out MKBs YouTube review on the Pixel 7 to get all the details.
