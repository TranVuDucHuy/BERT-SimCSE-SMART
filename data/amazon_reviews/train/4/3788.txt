I have purchased a couple dozen of these cameras over the past several years and find them to be overall very satisfactory, especially because they bring pretty good value (what you get for what you pay for them). I use the cameras with home servers that I have built for various of my properties. I run Blue Iris 5 software on the servers. Blue Iris is an outstanding product in my opinion. With this setup I can see the cameras from anywhere in the world and also control them (use an iPhone).The only problem I have had with these cameras is that they have an unusual propensity to go into a restart and recalibration sequence spontaneously and not recover from it. I believe this is related to the amount of power they draw and the PoE switches that I use to drive them. They are stated to draw 28 Watts, (PoE+), but I am suspicious that they draw a bit more than that. I have "burned out" two PoE switches that have 8 outputs rated at 30W per output. The telltale sign is that one or more cameras will start beeping and spinning, stop and then repeat the process endlessly. This is the process that the cameras go through on initialization out of the box. I suspect that the PoE power drops below the threshold required to sustain operations and that drives the camera into the initialization mode. I have been able to fix this most times by replacing the PoE switch. Ultimately, I bought $400 switches that supply PoE++ on every line and the problem went away (one exception - one camera after doing this routine for several weeks never would recover). I have not had a recurrence since buying this super-duty switch.If you are using one or several cameras you should have a good experience I suspect.
