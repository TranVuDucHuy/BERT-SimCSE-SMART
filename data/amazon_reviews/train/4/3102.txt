I bought this camera to replace an Amazon Cloud Cam in my office lobby, after Amazon decided to brick their Cloud Cams earlier this month. I only use the camera to live view my lobby on an Echo Show on my desk when I am in my office in back and someone enters the lobby. The Wyze Cam v3 connected easily with my Amazon account and I can simply say "Alexa show lobby" when I want the live view displayed on my Echo. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that there is no way to turn off the microphone. You can turn off the microphone if you are recording, but not during live view. According to the Wyze message boards this has been a long time complaint. I can say "Axela show lobby and mute volume" whenever I want to see the lobby without all of the background noise, but I do not want anyone to be able to listen in on my lobby and there is no manual or software switch available to turn off the microphone.
