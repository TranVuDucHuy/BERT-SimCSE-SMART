The product description and imagery mentions both "shotgun" and "cardioid", but these are not inherently the same thing. Cardioid mics capture most of the 180-degree region in front of the mic (which includes a fair amount on the sides). Pure shotgun mics capture sound along a narrower band directly in front of the mic. This Movo mic is a cardioid. Just clarifying. (For those like me expecting an ESPN-esque directional mic experience that just isolates sounds along the line of sight.) It's still better (much less noise) than the built-in omnidirectional mic on my smartphone.
