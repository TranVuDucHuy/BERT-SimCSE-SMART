I purchased the Reolink RLC-842A intending to use it with an older Synology Diskstation DS411j that I had retired from personal use. Since this was my first go around with either Surveillance Station (SS) or security cams in general the whole thing was a learning curve.I didn't find out until after I ordered the cam that while, Synology does support a number of Reolink cams this one wasn't on the list. But it turned out that there was a way to make SS access and use the camera through a manual installation SS wouldn't auto-detect the camera. Once I found enabling UPNP on the camera was the way to get access using ONVIF. But even then the features were very limited and directly accessing the camera using the REOLINK app was much more use and featureful.There are a couple nuances that you might want to be aware of. First be sure to place the camera with as little in the foreground as possible. This will affect the nightvision ability to autofocus and auto iris past any reflection from the IR light.The movement detect is awesome and triggers on everything. There are settings that allow you to blank areas of the field that may have high traffic that you are not interested in. And it does a good job differentiating between people and cars.The email feature is great. Sending a photo of the trigger event. The feature is configurable with a timer and is hourly presets for activity.Things I would like to see. The ability to FF and REW through the video and Delete files on the the SD card. An easier way to replace the SD card. Currently you have to climb to the camera and remove the shield to access the card.That's about it. So far so good!
