I like it a lot actually and it was super comfortable to wear after hours of use. I have a rather slim frame so this was perfectly snug. The plastic that clips the camera fastener to the chest mount is super fragile so careful when removing your camera from the chest mount. I had a little piece of plastic crack off already but it still hold the camera on my chest well. I mainly use this thing for fishing so I didn't want to spend too much. Definitely worth what it costs.
