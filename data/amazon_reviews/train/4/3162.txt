Works well, the light throw is not horrible and works well in a low light on-camera wedding situation in conjunction with an off-camera light. Basically you set it to a very low setting and it will light people who come close to the the camera and wont over exposing them. The off-camera light does everything else.The only thing I don't like about this light is the hinge. It's just useless extra weight that makes it just a little too heavy for quick emergency use on a gimbal that wasn't balanced for it. Also the hinge loosens after a while. On the positive, side, I've dropped it on a hard surfa a couple of times and it just keeps on working.By the way, the on/off switch is a hot pain.
