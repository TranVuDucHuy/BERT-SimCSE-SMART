A little slow to use, or process a quantity of slides. Negatives were even slower or more complicated to load in the trays.Maybe I am doing something wrong but unit cuts itself off every few minutes.Pictures come out being a decent quality copy of original…..a little grainy when displayed on 50” TV. Could not tell any difference in quality of pics when set on 14 Mp vs the 22 Mp settings.
