An awesome product and awesome design. Super easy to use. USB chargeable. 7 hours of internal recording. Lots of settings given the size and lack of buttons. Can record two discrete channels which is a game changer for solo operators. Problem is that the Sony A7S3 audio shielding is not powerful enough to block out the GO II’s signal. As a result there is near constant interference. Rode and Sony both could not solve this issue after much discussion with their support departments. There is a Reddit thread dedicated to the problem. It’s unfortunate that I’ve never been able to use the mics outside of testing.
