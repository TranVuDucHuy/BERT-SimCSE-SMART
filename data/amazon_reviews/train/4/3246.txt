Original review will be below this update:1-30-23 I was contacted by the seller as I wasn't thrilled with my original purchase. The customer service is amazing!! I was offered a different one to test and I took the opportunity. Glad I did. The new unit is amazing and exactly what I was looking for. I recommend going up to the lightbox with adjustable controls. Also added a star because of the amazing customer servicePrior review on original: Will take some practice but I'm happy how the pictures look. The instructions aren't clear for assembly. The USB end that goes to the lights isn't sturdy and I'm concerned it's going to break.
