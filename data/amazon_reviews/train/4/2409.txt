The camera quality is good, and the SD card function works which is what I wanted. However, I'm using it indoors to watch outside, so at night the night vision IR reflects of the window glass, rendering that feature useless. Color during the day and black and white at night. Picture is clear. Motion sensor is sensitive. Software and app works well EXCEPT for all the upselling for their cloud storage service. Really intrusive and annoying. Doesn't look like there is an option to select a cloud storage of your choice, so If that's a deal breaker move on. It looks like it has good detection features, but not worth 100$+ a year to me. This is good little basic camera, and that is all I want from it. I'd recommend it as a pet, nanny, or baby cam, but not an outside solution.
