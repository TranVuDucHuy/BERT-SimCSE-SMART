I chose this to use with my pen nibs and airbrush needles, and it works very well for that. There are a few points, both positive and negative, that i want to mention.PRO: Battery is not needed if you have the USB connected. You can actually remove the battery and it will still work as a camera on your computer.The manual says it doesn't work with Mac or Linux, but i guess that is more to do with the recommended software than the device itself. I tested it briefly in Linux, and it works in both OBS Studio and Cheese, without installing any special driver. I assume it would work in any other cam software. The device was listed as "GENERAL-UVC". I don't know if it works on Mac, but i'd be surprised if it didn't.CON: The battery indicator seems to be blank. I don't know what charge it has at any given time, other than the LED being red or blue.Really wish the resolution was full HD. 720p is okay, but it's 2023.
