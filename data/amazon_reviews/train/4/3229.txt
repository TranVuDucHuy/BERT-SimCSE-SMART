I just received this product. I took it out for the day test them. Took drive to local mountains north of Los Angeles. Nice bright day 12pm - 3pm, no clouds, 6,600 foot elevation. I slap the ND64 on shot at 25fps/30fps and 50/60 shutter for motion blur. I was overexposed few stops still In camera. I dont see too much use for the ND4 and ND8 with this drone at f/1.7 fixed. I emailed company told them they be better off taking out ND4, and giving us a higher ND128, or ND256. DJI ND filter kit has a ND16, ND64, ND256 in it for those desert days, and high sun.Update: Company reached out to me. They will be adding ND128,256, etc filter pack by end of the month. Just wish they had something higher in the all day 6 pack already. Very fast response from company, I like that.Other than that, they snap on real easy, nice case, and good price. But for me the ND4 and ND8 I take something higher. Now I am going have buy DJI ND filters just get a ND256 try it out in high desert, and high sun.
