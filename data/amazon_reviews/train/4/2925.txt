In my office these are pretty much a standard. Most people have them and use them on a daily basis.Pros - They are well made and feel very sturdy. The earpieces are comfortable and it is easy to get the correct fit. The battery life is good and they are easy to use despite hard to read and uninformative instructions (what's ANC?...). The range from the base station is good enough for most offices and the microphone quality is also fine. These are not intended to be perfect headphones for listening to music but are great for voice/teams/zoom calls.Cons - They are a bit heavy compared to wired headphones (e.g., Plantronics 3220) but this is part of their better construction and having batteries in them. I find that the blutooth is prone to interference in some parts of my office . There are a lot of clicks and hisses on the audio. I can duck into places where these don't occur and at home I don't experience this.These are a bit pricey but generally worth the cost if they are reliable. Recommended.
