I was very happy with the picture quality. But the speakers were very scratchy. I couldn’t figure out how to connect a blue tooth speaker. I first plugged in my headphones to make sure the audio wasn’t broken, and the sound was actually amazing. But it was hard to find a speaker online that uses an aux cord. I eventually found one in my house. The sound is very good with that. I also couldn’t connect my remote volume for my flex box to it because it only has TV options, not projector. That’s most likely because of the flex box and not the projector. But the flex box does work with this projector btw. I watched a YouTube video that said this is the best projector to get and he showed side by side comparisons to other projectors on Amazon. Works well with background light. I would recommend getting this.
