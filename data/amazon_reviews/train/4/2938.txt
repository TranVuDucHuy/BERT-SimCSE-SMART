These sound great, I used them for work on my PC and for listening to my audiobooks from my phone. My only issue is that the battery life is only about 6 hours of straight use. So I cannot get through a full day of work. I have just been charging during my lunch hour and they make it all day with the battery bump. But if skipping lunch they don't. Again these have been excellent in feel, weight, sound, battery life for my work usage is only 6 hours. If only using to work out or for less than 6 hours straight they are perfect. The charging case has been great to very compact. Functionality has worked with the buttons. I would buy these again.
