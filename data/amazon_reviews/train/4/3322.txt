I would have kept this camera if would have suited my purposes of getting professional sound out it, and it came SO CLOSE, but not close enough. I need to plug my mixer into a camcorder as I am doing Youtube demos of guitar pickups, using 2 XLR microphones into a stereo mixing board. I did get really great sound, but not at higher amplifier volume levels. The audio meter in the camera is just about worthless, very crude. I had to turn my mixer down literally almost to nothing or the camera's audio board would clip in a real ugly way. I have to use manual settings because auto gain control wouldn't give true sound for what I need to do. Otherwise, its an excellent walk around camcorder with a ton of great features. Battery life wasn't all that great, barely an hour, but most of them are like that anyway. I am sending it back and rather sad about it, but I ordered a JVC professional camcorder that has XLR inputs and a line input and a big level meter in the display, so its costing me double money to get that, but I need what I need and this camera just doesn't go there. So, if you read people plugging mixers into this camera, forget it. It can work but is just too primitive and hard to get it right. There was no level that I set that would stop the audio from peaking and distorting. But buy one if you want great 4K and aren't recording loud concerts of need to do pro audio.
