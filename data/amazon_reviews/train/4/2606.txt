The Blink Outdoor Camera's work fine and the price is reasonable. I also purchased the Blink Doorbells, one for the Front & Back doors. And, i picked up a couple for inside too. These were so easy to set up and control. Time will tell how durable they are but as of right now my home is covered inside and out for a fraction of what it would cost for many of the other security camera's on the market today. Peace of Mind!
