Its been great so far. thou wish it was GPS over Wi-Fi. I had one on my sunglasses case and the case fell out of my bag and i didn't notice it and it took me to where it last remember where but it was together with my phone but it was still lost. Also the wallet card one is noce except that the button on the card is so easily triggered that when i sit down it triggers the alarm. I mean it could have been designed better, I mean it gets annoying at times.
