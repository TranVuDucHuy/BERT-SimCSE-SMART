These are a good entry level IEMs. I bought these on August 2021, and they're still going good. I gotta say though, about a year in the left side cable started giving me some minor problems. When I sing I move a lot, and even though I can get them fixed in a very stable position, the left side has a faulty connection and goes silent when it's making poor contact. I almost got used to it already and adjust it to make good contact with the driver again. I'm not sure if this is a cable or driver problem, but other than that they still work very good.
