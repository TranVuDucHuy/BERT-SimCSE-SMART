The spotting scope is nicely packaged and the carrying bag is a plus. The phone adapter is designed for a single lens camera phones more than for multiple ones. I had to play with it to get it focused and seems that using a phone case instead of just a phone to attach it works the best. Don't expect high-quality recording though.
