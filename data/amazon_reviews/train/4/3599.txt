These are a very good choice if you're looking for a cheap pair of headphones! The noise cancelling isn't all that great, especially if you don't have music playing, but for the price it does the job. The battery life lasts literally forever. I've used them for roughly 5 hours and I'm still at over half my battery life still. Plus they're pink!
