We got this instead of buying a tv for our bedroom, and it is a much better alternative if you arenâ€™t picky!The fan is pretty loud, the speaker is not the best quality but we were pleasantly surprised, and the picture is decent too. I wish that you could adjust the picture with more settings, but I am overall happy with this purchase.
