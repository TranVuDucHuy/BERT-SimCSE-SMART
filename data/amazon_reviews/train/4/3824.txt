I ordered a 4 camera system back in 2019 along with the NVR. The original NVR LAN never worked but I thought it was user error and said oh well. Once I finally realized it was the system I reached out but unfortunately outside of the warranty. I ordered this new NVR and it works perfectly. I wish it would allow use of an external keyboard. It works with the Amazon basics remote mouse with included nano key though!
