I want to second the earlier review praising Emart for their excellent customer service. The two LED light units are very satisfactory for my macrophotography studio set up, which has very limited available space. The tripods are a little on the flimsy side, but perfectly acceptable. The lights are sufficiently bright and the mountings flexible enough for my photography needs. One unit failed after four months. I contacted Emart customer support using the information in the earlier review. James was extremely helpful and a replacement was shipped immediately and I had a usable system back in a week. Very satisfied with this!
