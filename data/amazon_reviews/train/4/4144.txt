This backdrop is decent quality for the price. I echo all of the comments that steaming is needed to get the creases out. Purchased this product for a cake smash photo session. It worked great but the cake (which had green icing) stained the backdrop. I tried to wipe it down and, though it came clean, the stain is still there. So...this is definitely a single-use product. Otherwise - I'm happy with the purchase.
