after having these for a couple months i want to gift them to all my close friends and family!! they are great!!occasionally they blip out for a half a second and whatevers playing goes silent. initially you think the music is stopping for an incoming call but the music quickly starts playing again..sometimes when i pop one earbud in after being in the charger case for a couple hrs it will announce the battery status and every once in a while it says the battery is at like 50% or a low amount when its actually been charging for the last while. once i go onto the app it correctly displays the battery level..the voice activation features only work when the app is connected. so when you pull the headphone out of the case and put it in your ear it will automatically connect and if somethings playing on your phone it will pickup and continue playing through the earbud.... all that being said if you dont physically open up the app and let the software auto connect on the phone app then the "Hello Skullcandy" wont work. the app pairing can sometimes take 3-7 seconds..the over ear plastic part of headphone that holds in the bud is not moldable or customizable it is a set dimension and will morph back to that set shape. personally i like this as im used to the way it slides over my ear and can put them on easily.something over looked is the ease of installation of a earphone with your non dominant hand. these require a hook, slide, and twist motion to get them over your ear and locked inthese could be like 20% louder and that would be awesome for highway rides in an old pickup while listening to a podcast conversation9.7/10 satisfied with purchase. have recommended to a handful of people already and next christmas a select few of my associates will be receiving these as a gift from me personally.JAWZ
