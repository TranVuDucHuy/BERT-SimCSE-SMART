I only have 1080P monitors so I can't comment on 4K performance, so only 4 stars instead of 5. I upgraded my Home Media Server Win11Pro with a new Graphics card (Zotac NVidia RTX 3060 Ti) so I could start gaming. This new card only has 1 HDMI port and I needed that to go my TV through the Home Theater Receiver so I can game on the big screen. My main Monitor (Display 1) for this PC is an ASUS 21" 1080P with an HDMI and a DisplayPort. This new DP cable has a better picture and refresh rate than the old HDMI 1.4 cable it replaced. The PC just works better with Steam when both Monitors are connected to the same Graphics card. The added bonus is that my ASUS monitor's built-in speakers started working with this DP cable right away! They never work through the HDMI cable even though I could select them for audio out. I would definitely recommend this cable!IMHO: From what I've read the audio/video quality of the newest version of DP is just as good as HDMI 2.1 for 8K. It is open source and doesn't take up any more space than HDMI. I don't know why manufacturers don't switch to DP so they don't have to pay licensing fees for HDMI. This could potentially save the consumer some $ on electronics.
