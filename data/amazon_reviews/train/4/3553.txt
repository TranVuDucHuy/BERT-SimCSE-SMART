Worth the price? - 4/5Would I buy again? - 4/5What I like - Solid product, but even better customer serviceRecently I bought a carplay dashcam to modernize my car. The problem was the mount it came with was less than useless. I needed something that wouldn't obstruct my view, and I decided to find a mount. Luckily I found this one.If you ever buy a product that needs to stick to something by adhesive, always ALWAYS wipe the surface down. It will save you headaches and re-adhesion. Also, make sure to let the adhesive cure for 24 hours. I did this with my first base, and unfortunately it popped off. I reached out to the seller, and they sent a replacement base immediately. The new base they sent stuck like a champ. I just took a short road trip, and I didn't have any problems with it sticking. I'd definitely buy again.
