Nice camera with a good image. However, the camera can only be viewed on Kasa's phone app. There's no provision for viewing on your computer's browser at home like you can with Nest's cameras.In addition, the camera's phone app is bundled together with Kasa's smart switches, outlets, etc., so you have to go through several steps to get to your cameras. Personally, I'd like to have an icon on my phone only for Kasa cameras.
