Bought this drone for my 8yo son on Christmas and it’s been a ton of fun for us both. I’m using an Xbox controller via Bluetooth to control it and found a cheap holster to keep my cellphone attached. The only negative so far is that it’s so small, it moves quite a bit with the wind, creating some blurry pictures and video. In no wind though, the clarity is surprisingly good. Awesome starter drone and will buy a better DJI when it’s time to upgrade.
