I would give it 5 stars if the solar panel would keep it charged up as you can see in the picture even with sun it will not stay charged at full capacity. Will work better if plugged in to electricity. Other than that I love this camera because I can move it around to where I want it. The alarm works great and love that you can set what areas you want to go off at if someone enters the area, and you can set it for want time you want it to start and stop. I have mine set between 11pm and 7am only because I know no one should be in that area. I would recommend this to a friend.
