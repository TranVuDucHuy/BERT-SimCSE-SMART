I bought this camera with the intention of taking on an upcoming trip to Italy. I wanted something versatile enough to capture landscapes but also some occasional wildlife. I found that the auto focus works pretty well even if you're shooting a cluttered subject like a bird in a tree. The first photo is a basic landscape. The color is true and the image is fairly crisp. The second image is of a screech owl in a nesting box. I zoomed in pretty much as far as the camera would go. The image is not of good quality. I was using a monopod to help stabilize the camera but that wasn't the issue. The image is pretty badly pixilated. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th images are of the same wall I found in the woods. As you zoom in you can see that the sharpness goes out the window. The last two images were taken with the lens at what I would estimate was about 300mm on a standard SLR camera. The images turned out pretty good. Overall I give the camera 4 stars because of it's ease of use, it's convenient small size, and photo quality between what I'd estimate is about 30mm and 300mm. But if you're looking to use this camera for wildlife, forget it. Trying to find active animals, such as birds, on the screen is frustrating and the image quality is just not good when you go beyond 300mm.
