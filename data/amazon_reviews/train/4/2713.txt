I purchased these because I was looking for a pair of cheap buds I can wear when I go for a run outside. If I run on the treadmill at the gym, I wear a pair of noise cancelling phones, but when I'm on the streets in my neighborhood, noise cancelling is actually unsafe. I should say all I use these for is listening to music as a distraction while I'm running - I do not use them for phone calls, so I can speak to their utility for that application. Here are my pros and cons after using them for a couple of weeks:PROS- Comfort. This is huge to me since I wear them while I'm running. They are flexible enough to fit comfortably over my ear while still remaining secure the entire time I run. I also wear glasses and they are comfortable to wear with them. The different size rubber tips help customize the fit in-ear.- Charge. So far, these have held a charge like a champ! Again, I only use them while running (about 30-45 minutes per wearing), but they will last a week or more without having to be recharged.- Connectivity. These paired with my Samsung immediately and I've had no issues with dropping or having to re-connect during use or between uses. I can't speak to distance from phone since I only use them when I'm running and, therefore, my phone is always at hand.CONS- Sound Quality. Look, these are $20 headphones. They are obviously not going to sound like Bose ear buds! The sound is tinny and thin, with almost no bass, but depending on what you're using them for, that may or may not matter much. It doesn't to me because I'm not looking for amazing sound quality while I'm out jogging - I just want something that'll play my tunes and distract me from my knee pain! These do the trick, but don't expect great sound out of them.Overall, I'd say these are good ear buds if you're looking for comfort and ease of use without being worried about audiophile-quality sound.
