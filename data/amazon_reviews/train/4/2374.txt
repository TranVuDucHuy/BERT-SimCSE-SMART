I was thinking that the video feed could only be viewed while at home while on the same wifi network as the camera, but I was very happy to discover that with the app I can view the video feed from anywhere.I also like that the camera can be adjusted left/right and up/down so that once I place it somewhere, I can easily fine tune the angles without having to put shims or something under it to prop it up just right.Night vision is good, and motion detection is good. It even picks up little moths or insects flying by.The only gripe I have is that the date of last motion detection is given in a few different places in the app (the home screen, the 24/7 recording section under the home section, the cameras screen, and the activity screen) but the dates don't always agree with each other. For example, the activity screen will show no activity on days when there are recordings under the 24/7 recording under the home screen. I've found the home screen and the 24/7 recording screen under the home screen to be accurate, so I reference that and ignore the other places activity dates are given.
