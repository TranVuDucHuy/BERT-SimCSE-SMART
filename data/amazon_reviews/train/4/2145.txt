Holds too lightly over my ears. Really good when talking while working. Easy to pair with devices. Sound quality and sound cancellation is just okay. I can recommend for people who works with both hands while talking or having a virtual meeting over the internet or phone calls. Although material used is just okay, am happy to use it while on phone than my airpods. People on the other side of the line can hear and understand me clearly.
