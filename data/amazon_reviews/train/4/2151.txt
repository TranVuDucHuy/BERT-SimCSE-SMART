These got delivered a couple weeks back and finally got to trying them so I thought id leave a reviewLooks: overall fine, they look a little silly bc of how wide it is on the top of your head but its a good item to buy if your head doesn‚Äôt fit most headphonesNoise cancelation: Its not really noise cancelling headphones, they just dampen the sound around you by a reasonable about-you‚Äôll still hear people talking when music is or is not playingVolume: Overall nice, im used to earbuds so I have some getting used to, only problem is that when you start turning up the music people around you can and will hear what‚Äôs playing, turning up your volume halfway is the safest bet (I enjoy loud music)Overall: Its really comfortable to wear, they can extend to fit your head, they‚Äôre really easy to useIts good for its price üëçI do recommend these if you want to stick the cheaper side of headphones, but if youre expecting high grade stuff you may want to consider spending an extra 50 bucks for something better
