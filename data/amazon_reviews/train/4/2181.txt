It is easy to set up and great to use. I listen to books at night and it is so much more comfortable than my headphones and not as heavy to say the least. If you fall asleep no problem as it is soft and the bluetooth is great as there are no cords to get in the way. I can play my book in bed and walk around the bedroom. I don't know about noise cancelling but they do the job. The only negative comment I have is they fit much lower on my particular head and its not adjustable and the plug spot to charge is a bit hidden under the fabric and takes a while to get the hang of it. Overall for the price this is a great buy!
