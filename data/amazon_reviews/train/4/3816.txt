Â The ZumiMall F5 is a very good, home security camera - outdoors or indoors. This review is for a batttery powered F5 camera (FW: 3.1.3.20220922) without 'cloud' storage mounted over my front door monitored on an iPhoneSE shared with an iPad connecting via 2.4G WiFi - distance: 15 feet through 3 walls wood frame, sheet rock, no masonry.The very good news:1. WiFi connectivity was very good - signal strength > 85%.2. Human movement detection was very good - it triggered on people walking past (12'-15' away), but did not trigger on cars at the same distance.3. Detection was very good in the dark (black and white record) as well as daylight (color record).4. Battery life was very good - in December cold weather, after 30 days, 362 events (approximately 750 MB) battery reports %41 so I expect 6 weeks is reasonable.5. Videos on the microSD card are organized in two folders for each day, AM and PM. Videos are MP4 2304 x 1296 15 fps monaural audio. 20 seconds of color occupy approximately 3.4 MB. 20 seconds of gray (night) occupy approximately 1.6 MB. A color sample is attached.The not so good news with the most important item first:1. Alert video cannot be downloaded from the camera - you have to unmount camera, remove microSD card. There are 'workarounds':- You can screen capture the alert video in the application on iPhone. Rotating the iPhone from portrait to landscape produces a full screen 'rotated' video capture. You can use a video editor to trim, rotate and resize.- You can live record with the camera but that is only 480p (640 x 480) 15 fps monaural audio.2. Alert Area Mask does not work. I would like to 'mask' alerts from people walking by in my street. I 'masked' the street, but this had no effect. This leads to extra alerts which I can live with but shortens time between recharges.3. Alerts are not viewable on shared device once the alert message is displayed on another device.4. The the most recent alert is at the bottom of the list for a given day. The most recent alert message is at the top of the list for a given day. I prefer a consistent ordering with 'top of list' as my preference.
