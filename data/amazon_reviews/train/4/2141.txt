I’ve used these working from home for 2 months now and think these are worth the money based on noise cancellation alone. Recently, we had our floor replaced. While working at home, the demolition of existing floor was done with a jackhammer/air hammer. My office does not have a door to close and the demo was taking place about 10 feet from my desk. The people on the other end of my Teams calls claimed they could not hear anything but my voice, even thought I couldn’t hear myself talking! I didn’t need to yell into the microphone or even raise my voice; I talked in my normal, “inside voice” tone.I do wish they were more comfortable, though. After a few back-to-back calls, I’m ready to take them off and give my ears a rest. I do adjust them a lot when wearing them as well; change the headband position, move the earpieces around, etc.All-in-all, I’m pleased with the purchase and recommend them for users with barking dogs, loud or noisy office spaces, working remotely in loud places or people that want a quality headset you can count on for a professional conversation via Teams or Zoom.
