This headset is one of the best around. My niece was looking at them for herself and I saw that they stated they were Ip7 waterproof. The price which really surprised me was Ip7 waterproof and under $50 as most other brands are in the $79-$150 price range. I thought well give them a shot at $39.99. I thoroughly tested them out at the gym and gave them a full workout. they stayed on ears really well with very little movement while on the Elliptical. The sound was kick butt booming with my club music and drowned out the gym noise. I then took them into the pool area and as I run/walk back and forth nonstop for 30 minutes, they stood up to the pool with flying colors. only when I went under the water did I lose connection (which is normal for wifi Bluetooth) but then came back up it told me it was reconnecting and the volume was at maximum. Even with waves splashing up against them they did not change the song or turn off (like a lot of other ones do, being touch areas were too sensitive), I was able to enjoy all of my songs to the fullest. The only thing when using them for phones, the left side is deactivated so only the right side is mono for calls. she told me this was the first time my call was really clear and good sounding ever!! they are comfortable and not heavy, I really did not notice them on me. the only downfall is the wrap around the ear plastic piece is a little cheap looking but would like them to look a little better designed. but overall 4 stars, if the high volume/bass at times break up the listening experience it would have been 5 stars. the noise canceling part will need to be tried out more to see how well they are at it.
