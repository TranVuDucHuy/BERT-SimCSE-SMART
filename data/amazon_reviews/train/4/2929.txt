This is my 3rd attempt to find a great headset for Teams meetings and having been using for 5 months now.Positives: Others say they can hear me perfect and I can hear them perfect. The ear covering is comfortable. I enjoy the charging stand to help avoid clutter on my desk.Good but not great: The range is decent but not great. For off camera meetings I wish I could walk from my home office to the kitchen but cannot without loosing reception. The true range is more like 30 - 40 feet. Battery is good but not great; I took the headset to the office one week and midway thru the 2nd day I started getting a warning about low battery (talk time was only about 5 hours before the warnings started).My only dislike: I have a larger than average head size, not a huge noggin but large, and this headset doesn't fit as well as I would like. Covering one ear fully it only covers about 9/10ths of my opposite ear which creates a small echo that I hear when I talk. I need to purposely move the opposite piece to be more off my ear to avoid the echo.Overall I really like the headset and while just slightly too small it is still the headset I prefer.
