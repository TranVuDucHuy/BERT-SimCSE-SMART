I have had multiple versions of blue parrot headsets. I definitely like this one. My only complaint is how the band fits my head. It’s a little tight and if you slide it down a notch it’s way to loose. I liked my b250 a little better bc of the metal band. It definitely fit my head better. But as far as controls, sound quality, and overall experience, it’s perfect. Can still have a conv at the back of a 53’ trailer while my phone is still in the truck
