I have taken a couple hundred photos using this film and I can say that it is generally okay but as some reviewers say, the images at times come out overexposed. There is defintely a learning curve to learn how to set the few filters and such in a way that your image will not come out too dark. I am still trying to figure out what is the Bulb function? I have gotten a lot of comments about the camera and the ability to do double exposures. Those are quite fun but also you have to remember to lighten it more than you think.Pros: instant images that can be manipulated. Small size is great but we need a better carrying book or bag that will keep the images safe.Cons: Just like with most films, if you are taking photos of differing skin tones, always light for the darkest skin tone otherwise that dark-skinned person will be a black blob on your image. At times, film gets stuck in the film casing and will not eject and you wind up losing a whole pack of film because you need to remove the packet in order to remove the stuck print.Suggestions to Fujifilm Instax. This is a great novice camera and I love that it is a hybrid camera. I would work on image quality more, including better control of how exposure affects your image. Perhaps a light meter reader would be ideal? What do we do with film that is stuck in its casing? Can we return it back to Fujifilm for a new pack? I have the SQ 10 and it's very difficult to hold. Any plans on putting handles on the side or better gripping system? Why can't we put a filter on our cameras for special effects, like a polarizer? Why is there so much trouble with photographing blue things? It is always either washed out or too dark.
