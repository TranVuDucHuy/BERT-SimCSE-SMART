last night i used this adapter to take these two pics of saturn and jupiter, (screencapped from videos), but i will say that the only thing that made me able to do this, was the fact that there was a nice bright street light nearby for me to point my telescope at, so that i could get my phone camera perfectly lined up with the eyepiece lens, because otherwise there is no way to do it at all, because the darkness you see when pointing your phone's camera at the black plastic surrounding the lens, and pointing straight into the lens at nothing, look the same. this isn't necessarily a flaw of the product, just a flaw of the overall idea, and no, i can't think of a practical and reliable way to solve the problem aside from just pointing it at something bright and unmoving while you get it lined up.another problem, which isn't a problem with the product but is still something annoying to consider, is that smartphones have power and volume buttons on the side most of the time. if your phone is like mine, you can only line up the camera with the eyepiece by clamping the mount on your phone so that the volume buttons are being pressed down. it is possible to mount it lightly enough that they aren't being pressed, but it makes for a very tenuous mounting situation because your phone isn't being held very securely, and you're supposed to mount your phone in it without a case on your phone. overall it just seems like a recipe for a disaster waiting to happen.so yeah, do with this information what you will.
