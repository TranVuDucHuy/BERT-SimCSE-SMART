Overall I like this camera body a lot, but I feel like it wasn't as huge a jump from a7iii as that camera was up from a7ii. It is definitely worth it if you are eyeing the a7iii but don't mind spending a bit more for nice features.Good:Everything that's great about the a7iii but now with:- 10-bit video- HEVC- 4k60- +9MP- ridiculously good AF, like stupidly good- higher available bitrates when using v90 cards.- Full size HDMI port- Streaming/direct usb stream support to make it the most epic webcam ever- improved ibis with crop based stabilization on top of mechanical sensor shiftBad:- I don't like how they made the body bigger. It feels quite big compared to a7iii.- the 4k60 crop sucks, as everyone else has stated. It's fine for tight shots but if you need to do something wide you will need a lens like 12-24mm- overheats in continuous 4K recording after about an hour at room temp. Yes, I set it to high temp threshold. It does still overheat just takes longer. Had to rig up a fan system for continuous longer recording (see pic). From my extensive testing, this solves the problem, and allows for recording for hours and hours even at 4k60, but I had to come up with it myself using parts from Amazon and SmallRig. If you don't want to do all this you may have to stick to 1080p if you're recording something hours long.- My rear top dial (the one I have assigned to iris, next to the EV Comp dial) started malfunctioning about 4 months in. Currently without the body as Sony is taking care of that under warranty. Not thrilled with that but hopefully the repair will last.
