Hooked this camera up to my ubiquiti switch to adopt/test before mounting outside. Glad I did because after About 45 minutes - 1 hr, there was significant condensation build upinside the camera on the lens (see photos). This camera is supposed to be IP67 weather resistant (basically completely weather proof/submersible) so this is pretty disappointing quality control for a camera that cost 3x the G3 base model. Amazon used to have very customer friendly return policies but I’ve learned the hard way that is definitely no longer the case so I thankfully did this before the return window got slammed shut.New camera is up and running and the picture quality/functionality is good. Biggest complaint is the motion detection is very laggy. The optical zoom is a little cumbersome so I would only plan to use this feature as a set up sort of feature and less as something you will use dynamically and often. If you’re on the ubiquiti platform and looking for a wide angle 4K camera this is the only choice. It’s a good camera, just very overpriced.
