The batteries are quite nice, but the Positive tip is slightly longer and wider than a conventional AAAThis caused fitment issues in my Olight I3e EOS. To turn the flashlight on, you turn the cap to turn the light on. Because the batteries were too long, the contacts would not close, causing the flashlight to not turn on.I took one of the batteries to a Dremel, grinding some off of the Positive tip, and now it works great!
