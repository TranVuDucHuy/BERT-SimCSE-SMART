Been wanting this for my studio so I got it. I had to install some extension boards into the studs and then install these on those boards to make everything fit for 86" rolls but it does what it's designed to do, and I'm happy with it. But, when rolling up or down (wall mounted), the middle and top chains will hit the chain guards on the lower ones. You have to sort of hold the chains toward the wall to clear those other guards. It probably wouldn't be a problem if ceiling mounted. Otherwise, it's a good investment and recommended if you shoot much in your studio and want to (relatively) easily swap backdrops.
