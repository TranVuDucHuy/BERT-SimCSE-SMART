It was easy to set up and align. Very well packed and triple boxed. (Double boxed from manufacturer and then an Amazon box outside.)Some of the items are cheap plastic, but what I'd expect for the low cost. The biggest thing I'd like to see on the tripod would be SnapLock legs. The legs on this one are knobs that you have to reach down and unscrew, then adjust and screw them back in. Not so good for quick adjustments, but they work. The Altazimuth part of it works well. I have not tried the software yet. I'll edit when I get that going.
