I bought the Galaxy Buds Live and decided to try the Galaxy Buds 2 to see if they seat in my ear better. They cushions that came on them would not seat well and the buds would almost fall out. I changed them and now they fit better.Pros:Sound quality is very good. I think the sound from these and the Galaxy Buds Live are about equal.Noise cancellation is better than the Galaxy Buds LiveThe Galaxy Buds 2 are easier to seat in my earCons:I wear earbuds when I bowl and the Galaxy Buds 2 will move a bit and I have to adjust them, but most other buds do the sameThe controls are a bit touchy whereas the touch controls on the Lives are not as responsive. When I have to adjust these, the noise cancellation will turn off and the sound quality drops significantly. This can be a pro as well as you can turn the noise cancellation off if you need to talk to someone; you do not have to take the bud out.
