I have been using these for about 3 weeks now and generally I like them! The sound quality is really very very good! Also, they are super secure! Once I get them on they do not move. I have used them on the treadmill, the bike and the gym floor. They stay put no matter what! Also they are very comfortable! I have very small ear canals and these work well for me. I am using the XS tip that was included. The only thing keeping me from giving these 5 stars is that they are super fiddley to get on! I certainly cannot do it one handed. I am not sure what the issue it but the way they open for the hook and then getting them on-the ear is just fussy. Overall I am very happy with them!
