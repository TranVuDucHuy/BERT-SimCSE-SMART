This is a ok replacement for their previous outdoor camera. The sd card option is beneficial and the system works more like a cctv system…but. I am doubtful the picture is in 2k. While the zoom function is really just an enlargement of the screen, this function is missing from recordings for some reason. I can “zoom” in only on live video and not the recordings. Why on earth would they do this? My alternative is to download each recording, where then I can zoom in using the phono app. If they’d at least fix this, I’d add another star. It just seems a no brainer.
