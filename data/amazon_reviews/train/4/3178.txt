Iâ€™m a frequent traveler and stay in multiple different hotels and airbnbs. This detector is so compact that I keep it in my purse and use it when I check into hotels/ airbnbs to scan the place before settling in.I love it and it packs a lot of power. The battery life is great and it gives me a peace of mind & safety. Only thing is you have to get the hang of how to use it but once you do You will never leave home without it! I would recommend this product to anyone who travels!
