 I have a problem with the film door - it doesn’t seem to stay tightly closed. It doesn’t effect the film but I have to make sure I’m squeezing the door as I take a photo so that I can click the shutter button. Other con, the light meter in this camera doesn’t pick up as much as I expected (it’s a quick learning curve though). If I’m shooting something in the shade and it’s daytime, I have to be SUPER close to the subject so the flash reaches. Comes out darker than expected in well lit rooms at night… but I actually love the results. It gives off a moody retro vibe! Very nostalgic actually.I love that I can take this cute little camera everywhere. It’s lightweight and so much fun to use. Double exposure works great. Timer is awesome, I think it’s 10 sec ? I also love passing it around and letting friends and family try it out, it’s so fun.In my opinion, I think if you’re an artsy and/or old-school type of person who can see value in imperfection you’d have much more appreciation for Polaroid film and therefore would get a kick out of this tiny little camera. You’ve gotta try it! Definitely buy it.
