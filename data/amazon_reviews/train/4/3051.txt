Let me start by saying this thing has awesome video quality and is very capable. With higher frame rates you can get buttery smooth slo mo for B Roll. The only problem I have with this camera is the fact that the battery, SD card, and power connection are all in the same place makes it very hard to run external power. There is a solution from a company called 3BR powersports model x-pwr-h8.
