I don't want anything on my dash, since one wouldn't look good in my car, so I invested in this. The locking makes it stay well in my cup holder, but the grip onto my phone is weak. It is nice I can lay it in it and pull it out easily but then again, a little better grip onto the phone would be more desirable. Not bad for the money.
