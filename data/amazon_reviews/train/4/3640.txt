I purchased these headphones as I needed a generic headset with microphone when working from home. The hard covering does provide sound dampening of from the environment. I didn't even hear UPS ring my doorbell one day when I was using them.They are comfortable. The sound quality and microphone are average, but it is functional for my needs.The headphones did stop working less than a year after my purchase. I contacted the seller, and he provided a replacement set. I was very pleased with the seller's response and would purchase these again or other items from him.
