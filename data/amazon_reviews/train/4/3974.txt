The app has live streaming and you can go back and view the whole day, it won’t give you quick previews when you set up motion detection notifications you actually have to memorize the time stamp and fast forward or rewind and even then you have to watch all the seconds and you cant skip to certain seconds so if an event happened at 12:06:55 you have to watch the whole minute. Which is a literal pain. Sooo many cool features actually, you can get sound notification too and they’re immediate(cool for nanny cams).The picture quality is pretty decent. Tho I don’t like how there are two light shining at night(one red and one blue). YOU CAN TURN THOSE OFF UNDER BASIC SETTINGS> IR NIGHT VISION!!The devices can also “fall asleep” if you have them on private for too long.It has 1-2 way talk, An alarm, Playback, record, screen shot, and more features. But no one told me how to actually access the live stream so I will be the one; Home Screen> tap device looking circle(next to blue plus sign top right) and that’s where you can see live feed{select playback bottom right}. Comes with two sticky pads for you to be able to mount to your liking. ALSO!!!! If you decide to use the stickies they give you for mounting on surfaces& you want your camera hanging off a windowsill and the camera is upside down you can select the camera (in app) and flip the orientation on the settings!!If you order the pair that comes with sd it already has them installed. Really quick and easy to set up.Honestly play around with the settings it’s really versatile and customizable. Not too great graphics but i loveeeee the customization in the app. I recommend downloading the app while waiting for the product to come in so you know what you’re dealing with tbh.
