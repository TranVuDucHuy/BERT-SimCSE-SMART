A little on the cheaper side it does have closeable plugs, the grey disks can be turned to cover the plug ports to protect against dirt and dust getting in, I use mine on a service truck so this is a plus, I did drop it once and and one plug cover popped off but easy to pop back into place, I didn't pay attention enough to see the plug ports are long ways with the length of the port which can pose a problem if you have big blocky plugs to plug into it, where one can easily block the adjacent plug. Would recommend for standard plugs, not big blocky plugs.
