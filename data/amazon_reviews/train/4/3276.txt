This product is fine. It's literally exactly as described, it does it's job, it does exactly what it says it will- nothing more, nothing less; but please trust me when I say, unless you are putting this on a tripod camera exclusively, or this is for a director/tech for their ease of stationary viewing, or you have some massive beefy rig, you do not by any means need a 7 inch. Trust me when I say that it is just too dang big. Do yourself a favor, and get a 5 inch
