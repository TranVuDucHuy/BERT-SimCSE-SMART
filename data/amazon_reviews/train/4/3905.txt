After trying another brand that didn’t work and no tech support after 1/2 a week tried this one. Connected to computer, downloaded software, fired up the VCR and success. True I have an extra step to import into Pinnacle, but this take minimum effort. Recommend this to all. One thing, I noticed they use the same tech support as the brand that didn’t work. Just saying.
