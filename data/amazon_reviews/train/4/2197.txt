It would be nice if these lasted longer. Brother is obviously making their money from selling the ink cartridges, not from the printer itself. All printer manufacturers do the same thing really, so there's nothing you or I can do about it. "They're expensive and they don't last long enough" describes ink cartridges from every manufacturer I've ever used.
