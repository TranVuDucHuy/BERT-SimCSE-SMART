 I could live without it. The video definitely does an amazing job at selling it to the customer audience. It won’t make or break your ability to clean your phone with or without it.Ps in the video I may have said “toothpick” but to clarify I meant “Q-Tip”My apologizes.————————Update 08/16/2022: 4 Star UpgradeWithin less than 24 hours after my posted review, the seller actually sent a message in regards to their efforts in providing a quality product to me and to assure its measure of worth.I have to say for a company to be so well versed and to be polite with kindness by expressing the proper use and guidance on its efficacy, it really brought measure to my review. In fact, they stand by their product and provide more insight to the functionality of the product.As a result, they are willing to help and to investigate any issues to resolve or answer any questions.I really appreciated the fact they sent a personal message to me and to make sure I received a valued product.So, in the end, if you are looking for a cleaning utility for your phone; it’s worth the shot to try. And maybe your own experience with the product might be more impactful. It does allow for easy transportation or on-the-go type situations (considering not always going to have a q-tip on an airplane or at the mall even). The size is perfect for any method of travel or placement in purses or other compartments like your car. And perhaps maybe even a q-tip can clog the speaker up with its debris.So why not! Try it! See what you think!
