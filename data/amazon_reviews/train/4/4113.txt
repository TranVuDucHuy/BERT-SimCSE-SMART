The SM7b has been my dream mic and I was so happy to finally get it. However, if you are just switching from USB to XLR mics for the first time like me, it is a lot more of a journey/expense than you may think!It has a beautiful build and the most attractive mic out there by far. Very boomy and I have a deeper voice for a woman so I did sound pretty nice with it. However, to fully make use of it you need to have a Cloudlifter as the SM7b is notorious for having extremely low gain.Materials needed/What I got:For basics you need a sound mixer, XLR cable, and optional but highly recommended, a cloudlifter.I got the Elgato Wave XLR (rn $159.99) but for the XLR cable a high quality one is recommended. Cloudlifter is $149 rn and the SM7b is $399.99. A popular mixer that is also used is the Focusrite ($179 rn).Therefore $159.99 (mixer) + $399.99 (sm7b) + $149 (cl) = $708.98+ starter price not even including the XLR cable.So keep this in mind if you plan on using this and that you are ready to jump into this investment. It is worth it if you have the money/resources needed!
