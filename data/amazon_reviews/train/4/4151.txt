We got this camera for my son to take to sleep away camp, where cameras were encouraged but he couldn't bring "electronics" and wouldn't be able to charge devices. Though I was initially discouraged by the reviews about the poor photo quality, I decided to buy it after reading the headline, "Only slightly better than a disposable camera." Our only other option was a disposable camera and this was a way better option, considering the price, the large number of photos it could hold, and its ability to also take video. It also was the only inexpensive digital camera that used batteries, which was essential in our case.Sure, the picture quality isn't great but it definitely captured very special memories -- even the memory of the camera accidentally falling into the water and being perfectly fine. (He then took a video as he deliberately jumped in the water holding the camera.) When the camera first arrived we took some test pictures indoors with the flash and they really were quite terrible (a grey wall--and everything else-- appeared orange!) but at camp without a flash the colors look perfectly fine. Close-ups aren't always focused on the intended object. Outdoor, daytime, long-view scenic shots turned out best and are quite nice!We were able to upload the pictures to our computers and watch the videos with sound (playback on the camera is visual only). It was well worth the price and a much better deal all around than a disposable camera.
