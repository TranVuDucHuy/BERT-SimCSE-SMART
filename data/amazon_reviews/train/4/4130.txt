Reasons I like this stand: breaks down into two small sections that fit into the bag and is very portable. Your traditional mic boom stand, even when folded up, is probably twice as long and takes up twice the space.Things that could be improved upon: the overall footprint of the base is somewhat small. So if you mount a heavy mic and extend the boom arm to the max point, it will tip over. If you use a sandbag it will be fine.So the trade off for the portability is a smaller base footprint. It hasnâ€™t caused me any issues yet, though, and I use it multiple times a week recording audio for video.
