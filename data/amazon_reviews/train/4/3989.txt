I've bought several budget projectors. I got this one for $299 on black Friday. Each one I've bought was a little better than the previous one. None of them seem to be able to get a perfect focus. This one is closer but not as good as an name brand. The auto focus works ok. Sometimes I have it refocus a few times until I get a good one. The manual focus is not easy to do. It's a button on the remote. The amount it moves is not easy to control. It also can only be done on the settings screen meaning the picture you have to focus with not ideal. You can't get a nice test pattern to set the focus.I do have some light bleeding in from the edges on a black picture. It's not real bad but noticeable for sure.The way the fan works is it sucks air in around the projection lense. This seems stupid to me. All the dust goes right to the lense. It's like the fan is running backwards. Why wouldn't it blow out around the lense to keep dust away from the lense?? You can actually watch dust get sucked in right around the lense.This is my 4th budget projector. It's the best one yet. I do use it everyday as my primary tv. If you are crazy about picture quality you likely won't be satisfied. If you just want a big screen like me then it's worth $300
