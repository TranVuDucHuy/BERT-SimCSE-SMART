I've tried multiple Reolink rtsp cameras. In all cases, there is a significant video delay that builds up over time to over 30 seconds when used with Blue Iris. This make PTZ virtually impossible to use.The quality of the image and zoom capabilities of this camera are outstanding for the price. It has a built-in web page for control and viewing that works well and does not suffer from the same delay as when used with Blue Iris.I would have kept and not returned the camera, were it not for the delay problem. Further internet research showed that many others experienced the same issue. Ultimately I had to select a different camera brand.
