This projector is pretty cool although I had trouble getting it to connect to my iPhone. I believe this is an iPhone glitch, however and not the projector's fault. Regarless, it was a little confusing to work at first but then I got the hang of it. I connect it to my laptop and stream movies. I use it in my bedroom since I don't have a TV and I'm not a huge TV watcher. I use this from time to time. Great for the price. I just wish the bluetooth or casting worked with my phone because it would be easier to use wireless than connecting the HDMI cable to my laptop.
