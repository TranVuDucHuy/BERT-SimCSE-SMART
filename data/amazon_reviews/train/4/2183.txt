I can finally wear a headset and charge my phone at the same time. I understood it does not fast charge, and I used my original charger cord and charging block that I got with my phone. After using this once, I have speculation to believe it messed up my fast charger. To be fair I had the same charger for two years, but all of a sudden it can only normal charge my device? Seems too coincidental to me.TL;DRBe wary of using it with certain chargers.Otherwise it is what you paid for.
