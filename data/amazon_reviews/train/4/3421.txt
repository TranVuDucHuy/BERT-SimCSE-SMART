I purchased this speaker after seeing other positive reviews and was not disappointed. I don't think you will find a better quality speaker in this price range.I bought 2 for myself and the stereo pairing works great, too. I liked them so much I got one for my step-dad and brother-inlaw this past Christmas.Highly recommend!
