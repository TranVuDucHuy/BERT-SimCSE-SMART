A lot of reviewer's on U tube claimed these earbuds have too much bass to really enjoy, let's keep it real, all earbuds these days have to be adjusted, this is not back in the day where everything was set straight out of the box, and it was all about the quality of your CD'S and CD player or cassette players, now days you have to be your own sound engineer, these earbuds are capable of any particular sound you want or need, Soundcore have a very unique companion app, once you become familiar with your custom EQ settings you can apply it to all your Soundcore earbuds, with noise cancellation on, it will give you a more bass driven sound, ambient mode will make it sound thinner, normal mode will make it sound flat. Keep in mind, your phone has a EQ running at the same time from the phone internal settings, they may conflict with each other, turn your phone EQ off then start your custom EQ settings on the earbuds app, then turn the phone EQ back on and adjust the earbuds again, then compare which sounds better to you, I have a 3rd party EQ app that will enhance every aspect of the sound of any headphones or earbuds, after the proper adjustments, these earbuds is almost perfect, also keep in mind you have to the right size ear tips to seal the best sound. All your music will not be digitally mastered on the same level from the recording studios, some may have a HD, hi res sound, and some may not, if certain songs seems like it's lacking something, it's not your earbuds, it's the sound quality of the song, to correct that problem, all you have to do is create several EQ settings with different highs and different lows and name them, you can create the best sound quality for any song. Soundcore is on top of their game, they create great sounding product's, but at the same time, they leave it up to you to create the best sound you like. Although these earbuds are considered sports earbuds, they're really high performance earbuds for any occasion. The reviews that said the bass is too much, that only tells me they don't have a clue on what they are doing. There's a android EQ app that can solve all their problems for free. To Anker Soundcore, Thank You. You are truly appreciated üëç
