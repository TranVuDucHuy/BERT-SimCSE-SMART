I bought this during Prime Day for my 15 year old daughter who is just starting out in photography. When it was delivered the box looked like it was thrown around but thankfully nothing was broken or damaged. There was only 1 flaw with this, the backdrop support, one of the holes was not drilled evenly with the other so it does not fit correctly on the upright support stands when using less than 2 bars (the ones that hold the backdrops). Easy fix for us though, my husband can fix it. Other than that 1 flaw it’s great. She prefers using just the softbox lights mostly but does occasionally use the umbrella lights. Would recommend if you are just starting out in photography, it is a great price. The flower basket photo I attached is with using the black backdrop, 1 umbrella light and 1 softbox light. The other photos were taken right after we took everything out of the box and set it up (that’s why the backdrop is still wrinkled and creased), they were taken using the white backdrop and both softbox lights, no umbrella lights used.
