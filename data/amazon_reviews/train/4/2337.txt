When I first tried spinning this it did not move smoothly and would get stuck . I inspected it and found that the plastic molding had a spot in the rail with some excess plastic . I used a razor knife and trimmed it off and then it worked smoothly . It is an easy fix but should be noted that their plastic molding had this flaw. I also noticed that handle you hold had not had the two pieces glued together in perfect alignment. This did not effect the operation of the reel but just shows the quality of the work has not a lot of care. Who knows how many of these a worker must produce each day and perhaps that is the reason for lack of detail. I don't want to complain because this is a very inexpensive item that I will use to roll up electric fencer wire. I would get another one for the price it is a good deal if not expected to do a lot of heavy work.
