So far, so good. We started off in February of 2022 with Blink outdoor cameras and a video door bell. Those are barely adequate during the day, but, especially the nighttime video, is unclear at best; you would never be able to make out the details of anything moving. However, this Kasa camera is far superior. First of all, Blink now charges $99 for one camera which is absurd. Then you need to purchase a separate power cord and a mount that actually works. This Kasa not only comes with a built in power cord, it comes with an adequate wall mount and the image is quite clear both day and night. We already have other Kasa products, so the setup was already familiar, but even so, it is fairly easy for even a first-timer. We have an Alexa Echo 8 and this camera automatically hooked into that system with no further setup. I really like this camera, especially at around $45 and would definitely recommend this and other Kasa products.
