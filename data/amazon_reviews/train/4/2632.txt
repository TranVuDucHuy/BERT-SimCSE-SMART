This camera works great for checking on my pet. Video quality is good night vision could use some work. I've had this for 6 months now and I just changed my email and unfortunately there is no way to update my email address. I can add a new one, but I camt delete the existing. That's a problem for me. So now I'm looking to replace the cameras I purchased and toss these bluerams.
