This is a a great tool to have on hand. It effectively removes debris and dust from the charging port, ensuring a stable charge and prolonging the life of the device. It's small and easy to use. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to keep their iPhone in tip-top shape. I wish the plastic tips were a little more sturdy but you can always order replacements.
