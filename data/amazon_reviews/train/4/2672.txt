Has a nice little carry bag but I also keep mine in the box for more protection. Optics are pretty good out to about 200 yards.In my opinion the phone holder needs to be improved I probably won’t even use it because of how difficult it is to align the phone and then get it on the scope. It may be due to the silicon case I have on my phone but the suction cups don’t hold well I had to use rubber bands to hold the phone onto the adapter. It also is a little blurry when trying to see what you’re looking at on the phone as it’s a tiny viewing area.
