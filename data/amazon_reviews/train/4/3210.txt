The only thing I dislike is that it won't work USB to USB-C whenever I select the phone option it will not project anything on my phone... I'm not sure how to get the "zoom" feature to work either but I don't really need it for what I'm doing.I use a laptop though and it works perfectly. I only wanted a projector to display an image will I trace it.. so I was looking for a very affordable one as I won't even be using it for movies or anything else. The brightness is great and it has an option to focus. Overall it does what it needs to do and works great!
