Upon receiving the earbuds, I took it out of the box and it pared quickly and easily. I bought these specifically because they included 2 additional sets of ear clips . The other earbuds I was considering did not include any ear clips which I would have had to purchase separately at an additional cost. Decent quality at an exceptional price. It would have been an added benefit to include different size ear cushions.
