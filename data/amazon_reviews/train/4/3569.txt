There’s not a ton to say. It’s a basic surge protector. I’m using it to run as an extension of the end of my workbench. I’m only running a couple battery chargers and maybe a shop vac from time to time. There are definitely heavier duty units available than this one though. You common sense. If you plan to use this for more than light use just spend the money and buy a nicer surge protector.
