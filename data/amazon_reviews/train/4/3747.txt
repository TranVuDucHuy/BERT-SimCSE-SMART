This is almost the perfect projector. I could have given this projector 6 stars out of 5, unfortunately mine has pixel defects (dead pixels / white dots) that are visible during dark scenes :-(Originally I bought this projector for my Halloween window digital decorations as it is bright, colorful and sharp (1080P). The dead pixels do not affect too much for this purpose so did not want to go through the hassle of returning it and risking getting another defective unit.Despite its defect I have fallen in love with this projector so much that I am frequently using it to watch movies with family and friends as it provides an amazing picture and the sound is surprisingly good (better than my Vizio Tv).PROS* Best value for less or around $100* 1080p native resolution that produces sharp images and it can handle 4K sources.* Vibrant colors* Brightness is great on dark rooms, not so good when there is light in the room* Great sound from such a small speaker on a room of 14 x 11 feet* Reasonable screen size ( I project a 90" screen with projector placed at 9'9")* 1/4 inch hole to mount on a tripod (great for Digital Window Decorations for Halloween)CONS- Dead Pixels (White spots on dark scenes)- Keystone adjustment not so good, If projector is not placed almost dead centered then image will not be sharp around edges. Once it is centered image becomes sharp from edge to edge.
