I haven't had for very long, so I can't speak on durability. However, for under $50, these headphones are great. They are comfy to wear for long periods of time. I sometimes study for 8+ hours at a time while listening to music and they don't hurt like other headphones or earbuds that I've tried. The ANC is amazing if you have sensory issues and/or ADHD like I do. It won't completely block out loud sounds, but it definitely blocks out any annoying minor background noise that you just don't want to hear, which is always the issue for me personally when getting work done. So, it may not be great if you're looking for something that 100% cancels all background noise.The sound quality itself is almost as good as my Beats headphones. My only complaint is that when I have it plugged into my computer or iPad, sometimes the left side of the headphones won't work unless you play with the plug a little. That said, I do like that you can use them with both a plug and bluetooth option. Also, it smelled very bad coming out of the package; like a mix of fake leather and nail polish remover is the best way to describe it. Hopefully this will get better as time goes on.These headphones are definitely not going to be as nice as their more expensive counterparts, but if you're looking for a more affordable option that provides the basics of noise cancelling headphones and has decent sound quality, these will do.
