Due to Amazon discontinuing the Cloudcam, I was forced to choose a new system. I had multiple cameras, as well as new ones stored in my garage, but all they were offering was one blink indoor camera so I had to go with something.Pro's- Easy to setup and install, pretty decent user interface, motion/privacy zones selection, optional hardwire with micro-usb vs batteries.Cons-Standard mounts aren't that great, so had to purchase upgraded mounts. The usb power connection wasn't compatible (size) with cloudcam power housing, so I had to cut the hole out of the new camera backing to make it fit or have to re-wire all previously existing hardwire. Takes a long time to connect to the camera when you want to see live view, even when you have it connected to power (assuming this was to save battery life and you have to wait for signals to turn on), but it should be instant. IR isn't very powerful, but there is an option to buy IR arrays separately to increase area night vision, which I already had installed.I have one camera running on batteries to see what the life is, so far ( a few weeks) it is still good to go.
