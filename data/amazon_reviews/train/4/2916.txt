I really wanted to be amazed by this unit but it came up short. I bought this to replace my Bose micro speaker. The Bose worked great with excellent sound quality at all volume levels but after the first year kept going into default and needed constant updates. The battery life on the Bose was ok but would not last more than 6 hours. After much thought I choose this JBL unit. I liked the 12 hour battery rating (will not last 12 hours on the higher volume settings), the higher watt rating and the ability to tune the speaker. This speaker sounds very good at the lower to mid volume settings but does experience distortion at the upper end. In the end it is an ok speaker at a reasonable price that should be able to handle the dusty environment of a construction site.
