I loved this product from the minute I ordered them. Delivery look way longer than originally expected. Could have Ben due to holiday rush. I immediately install them onto my Apple Watch. Unfortunately, after three days the band section that slips into the watch broke, it cracked in half. I love the bands so much I decided to give it a second try. Second delivery came as predicted. Iâ€™ve now been wearing it for two days with no problems. Hopefully these will last longer than the first set.
