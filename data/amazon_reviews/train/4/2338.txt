These are easy to use and will work as advertised but in order for the spoolt to move freely without locking up you will have to deburr the plastic injection points left over from molding on one side of the spool. There are about three of them, and the handle will not move completely around the spool without the removal of this excess plastic. It's easy to remove with a rotary tool and a small grinding tip. The handle is also excessively loose and will need to be tightened. Otherwise, it works well and a 100 foot 16 AWG 3 Conductor extension cord will fit on it.
