My wife and I started using lights instead of flashes for wedding reception photography. There often isn't enough light for our lenses to focus while only using a flash, so lights like these help keep our subjects illuminated in high-action environments. I don't love the interface for choosing brightness and color temperature. It takes a while to change those features. However, for the money, it gets the job done. We typically find a good brightness/ hue combo at the beginning of the reception and leave it for the rest of the night.
