To me, quality matches the price.My uses:Watch video on my tablet in bed, or use it on the train when I travel a few times a year.That's it.Experience:- noise cancelling is decent enough that I have no complaints. I have to take them off to hear the train announcements clearly. I do hear my cat stirring and my snoring partner, at night but it's barely audible.- button placement: for the love of all that is good, manufacturers need to hire UX teams - these tiny buttons placed around the earpiece (from any mfg) never make sense and are hard to find. Put. Them. On. The. Sides. With. Different. Sizes. And. Textures.- the bass is decent, the treble is decent, voices are clear.- I wear them for hours at a time, with glasses, and I have no complaints other than after about 2 hours I can feel the glasses pressing into my face and a quick adjustment clears it up.I'm a "turn on, use, turn off" person with headphones. I'm not an audiophile. I want some noise reduction, I want comfort, I want a decent battery life, and I want the sound to be clear.Like everyone, I've had countless headphones over the years. These are priced right for what they provide. Not bad, not great - just perfectly decent for general daily use.
