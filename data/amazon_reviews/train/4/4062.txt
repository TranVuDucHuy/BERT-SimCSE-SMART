Holy Cow!The field of view of this lens is awesomely wide. I use it with a Canon Digital Rebel XTi and a Canon EOS 70D (both APS-C sensors), and the photos you can get with this lens is almost freakish.This is my new favorite indoor lens when I'm shooting kids and family. If you need to shoot a lot of wide angle (to catch the action) candid/family type indoor shots, buying this lens is a no brainer and a great value. It's not going to set you back by a lot and you'll find yourself using it a lot.It is plastic construction, so don't expect to treat/mis-treat it like an L series lens. At 10mm to 18mm its a perfect compliment to Canon's common 18-55mm kit lens that comes with a lot of cameras. With the STM motor its a fast and quiet focuser for the DSLRs that do video. It's a surprisingly larger lensI do have one complaint about this lens: at f/4.5-f/5.6, it is not fast enough! I would LOVE to have this lens at f/4, or f/3.5 (like the 18-55mm kit lenses), or even better, f/3.2 or f/2.8 for wide open. Having only f/4.5 wide open at 10mm indoors (with indoor lighting) means slower shutter speeds or bumping up the ISO to 400, 800, or 1600, which is less than ideal, or even worse, having to use flash. When shooting outdoors during the day/evening, f/4.5 is fine because I typically shoot either f/4, f/5.6, or f/8 outdoors anyways, so with this lens I just set it to f/5.6 or f/8 and can zoom in and out without having to change any other exposure settings. I just wish it were faster for indoor lighting shots.I'd be willing to shell out an extra $25-$50 to get the same lens in at least an f/4, and $100 to get f/2.8. A great mark ii version of this lens would be to keep the 10-18mm zoom range, drop the IS, make it f/3.5 at 18mm (the same as their cheap kit lens at 18mm) or f/4.0, and go bigger aperture as the picture got wider. At least f/3.5, or f/3.3, 3.2, 3.1, or 2.8 at 10mm would be wonderful for shooting indoor lighting levels with no flash.
