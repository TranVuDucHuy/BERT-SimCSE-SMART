Overall I'm happy with the Hero 10. The biggest issue is that it's easy to accidentally switch modes and e.g.think you're taking normal video but actually doing time lapse. It's happened multiple times, to me and others using my camera.It's also really annoying that it drains the battery as much as it does when it's off. I understand it needs to draw some power to keep the clock accurate, but it seems like it will draw a full battery down to zero when turned off for a few weeks, which is ridiculous. I pull the battery out if I don't know I'll be using it again within a day or so.
