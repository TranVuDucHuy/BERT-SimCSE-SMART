Look, these are very bass heavy with zero mids and decent highs.The bass is very muddy.I use an app called Neutralizer to try to balance it better and it DEFINITELY helps but these are what they are.For $30 and for my use (the gym) they're worth the money.I bought these to substitute for my pixel buds pro my kids lost.Those sound studio quality compared to these.Also, there's no lid to the charging case. Poor design there.
