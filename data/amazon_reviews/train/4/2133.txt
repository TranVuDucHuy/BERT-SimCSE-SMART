All parts/tools included aside from a screwdriver. Easy assembly. It’s a heavier tv (semi older in the 60” range) so it’s a little flimsy but it’s on there. For the price it’s a good buy.Only major adjustment that could be made is the bracket holes that hold the screws going into the back of the TV should be slightly oval instead of perfect round so you have wiggle room getting it to line up. But again, I got it together, just a suggestion.4 out of 5 overall for the price point.
