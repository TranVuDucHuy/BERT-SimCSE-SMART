These headsets are light, comfortable, and do a great job with noise cancellation.They do NOT have a longer range than my 10 year old Logitechs though, so don't expect the range to be much greater than your basic Bluetooth.My biggest gripes are:. When you click on mute in Zoom or Teams with your mouse, you hear a loud MUTED. When you click again, UNMUTED. Every single time. It's super annoying.. The On and off switch is a tiny slider that you can only really move with your nails, and it has 3 positions, Off, Dongle, Bluetooth. It's easy to pass up the middle position and all together it's not easy and comfortable to turn on and off. And not something you can easily feel for while on your head.. Finally it doesn't have USB C. In this day and age, why not?
