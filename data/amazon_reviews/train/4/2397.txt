I am very happy with this purchase, the price is very good for how high quality the image is. I would imagine because of this the build quality might suffer a bit, as you can see somewhere in the lense housing is a spec of dirt or dust. It is mildly annoying and for the price not a big deal. Just a little disappointing from a product that is so promising to have this issue out of the box.
