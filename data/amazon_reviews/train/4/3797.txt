My mailbox is about 50 yards from my front door. Even though it has a little flag that pops up when mail has been delivered, it's just far enough away that I can't quite make it out unless the sun is hitting it juuuust right.I'm lazy. I didn't want to walk all the way to the street unless the mail had arrived. I decided the simplest solution was to get an inexpensive pair of binoculars that would allow me to easily check the little flag.I wish I could figure out a way to take a snapshot through the binoc's eyepiece so show you the improvement, but alas, I'm not coordinated enough to manage that. Suffice it to say, I'm very, very pleased.The resolution is crisp & clear, while the color clarity is great. No odd tints or casts.Following the advice of another reviewer I went with the 8x21 size.Should you decide to do that please don't be dismayed when you open the package to find a box with markings indicating a 12x52 set inside. Seems like they only have the one kind of box. On one end of the box is a sticker that properly identifies the 8x21 pair inside.You'll be astounded by how small these things really are. The case is about 1" thick & roughly the size of a credit card in height. A simple lanyard comes attached as well so they're easy to dangle from your neck as needed.Easy adjustment instructions and a lens cleaning cloth are also included.Very, very pleased. No, they're not for the professional birdwatcher, but for ease of always having a pair handy & the pricing, you cannot go wrong.
