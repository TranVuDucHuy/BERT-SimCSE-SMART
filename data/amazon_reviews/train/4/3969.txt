As promised, I am updating my review.It was shipped from Amazon distribution and took them 3 times, sending previously returned items, they still couldn't get it right.I am extremely grateful for Kelly of Flatsailtrad (seller) for her exceptional customer service. She made sure I received a NEW projector with all the peripherals noted right on time for my event.The projector is great! Easy to setup/use, the picture is really good, even from far away. The sound output with outspeakers is good.I couldn't give a full 5 stars because there is unfortunately a slight delay with the sound. The power cord is also extremely short.Other than that, it is a great buy!----This projector has signs of prior use and missing the remote.Will make a new review once I can actually use one that hasn't been used.
