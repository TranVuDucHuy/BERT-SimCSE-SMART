For the money, these sound decent but I’m picky when it comes to sound quality. I just needed some cheap headphones to use at the desktop PC for watching YouTube videos. These are good for that. They don’t sound nearly as good as my Koss PortaPro but those are 4x the price and probably the best sounding cans under $40.
