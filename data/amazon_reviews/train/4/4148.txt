The Free Soldier 20x50 military binoculars worked great for a couple of weeks, then somehow became double vision. No amount of adjustment could bring the two images together. I contacted the seller twice but have not heard back from them.Update: the seller finally contacted me, and I resolved the issue myself. The main object lenses are housed in conical plastic frustums (truncated cone) which screw into the body. I discovered that one of these frustums had been bumped out of alignment, and the threads into the body were cross-threaded. I simply unscrewed the frustum, then re-screwed it back in straight, which removed the double vision. As a cheaper product that nevertheless works well, I would advise future purchasers to take extra care to avoid rough handling of these binoculars (even unintentionally). Use the included packaging to cushion the binoculars during transport and storage.
