As with any projector in this price range (and most under $300) the overall brightness isn’t there meaning you need to use in a dark space, this type of lens and optical setup is mediocre and causes blurry images on the sides while perfectly clear in the middle (adjusting keystone makes it worse), and this projector is only able to display 720P video (does support 1080p but the upscaling sucks and causes choppiness in any action projected) but $60 (at time of purchase) is a great price you can still enjoy large projected images and movies while they’re not always in perfect focus you could do a lot worse than this. Overall I would recommend this projector but it will NOT replace your tv or be usable in bright rooms (I’m talking a tiny table lamp dramatically washes the image out) just keep your expectations in check. For me it’s perfect because I mostly use at night and it scratches that itch for large projected images at a low cost. One day I’ll splurge and get something better (like laser 4k projector)
