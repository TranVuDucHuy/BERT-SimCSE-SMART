I used Canon for years and had the EOS R for some time. I had lenses and all but I felt like I didnâ€™t have the right hybrid camera. I tried the Sony A7C and A7III and decided to pick the A7IV. No regrets! I love the IBIS, the video quality is fantastic, lenses are decently priced vs Canon and the accessories I found for it are top notch. The color science and back screen are not as good as Canon but I need this for photo and video, so those things are first world problems I can deal with. Love this camera!
