You set up and connect to the microscope's connection over wi'fi, then go back to your own connection when you're done. The microscope doesn't work without its own connection. I followed the set up instructions and it wouldn't connect. I'm an ok techy person, repeated everything more than once, and tried everything I could think of to solve the issue. Well, even if I had gotten it to work, the whole process is just way too confusing and complicated! Returned.Update 11/26/22 First, I want to thank the seller for contacting me, without any mention of changing my first review, and offering a replacement. I wanted to give it another try so got the replacement and followed the instructions and it worked. OK, here's where I went wrong the first time: when it got to the part in the app that told me there was no internet, my techy self got side-tracked into trying to fix the internet connection. SO, you've got to ignore that and proceed, like it says in the directions. For what it is and what I need it for (hoya bug inspections) it's a good solid piece of equipment. I took off one star because I spent so much time getting confused about the internet and then having to go through the return process. But I'll have to say, the directions were right all along.
