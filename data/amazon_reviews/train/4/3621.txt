These magnetic chargers are doing the job and will charge both my iPhone 12 and my iPad mini 5… it charges at normal speed … my only issue with them is that the tops heat up and get pretty hot… I am a bit concerned about the heat issues… the C tips I have used to charge my Nintendo Switch Light and again, the tips get pretty hot… the micro tips also heat up when charging my flashlights and uv lamps… I will continue to monitor the charging tips to make sure that they do not overheat and cause damage to my equipment… the cables themselves are very nice… I like the nylon braiding on them a. Dina,so like that they are very flexible and not really stiff like other charging cables… so far, everything is going ok… it’s just the heating up part I am worried about…
