This boom pole stand is good for small spaces and at home content creation. I've used it with various mics to test the weight and I've had to use a sandbag to keep the pole from falling, so the lighter mics will work best if you don't have a sandbag. It is a basics brand so I wouldn't use for high production shoots.
