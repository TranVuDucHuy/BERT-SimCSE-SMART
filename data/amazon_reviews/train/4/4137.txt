This screen protector was purchased for an iPhone 8. The protection seems really good. There were 2 in the package, along with 2 of everything needed to install them. So if your installation of the first item wasn't perfect, you had a 2nd one to use.My only 2 issues were:* the method of application left a lot to be desired. Many of these screen protectors come with a thin plastic frame that works with your phone and the screen and the fit will be perfect. This item uses 3 pieces of tape. You apply 2 pieces of tape to one side of the screen edge to act as a hinge that you'll flip out of the way while you clean the phone screen and ready it for the protector. The 3rd piece of tape acts as a handle to swing the new screen protector into place. This method is a bit sloppy if you're not careful since the slightest movement can cause the hinges to not act properly, or that tape stick to itself and cause the protector to get repositioned incorrectly.* The screen protector doesn't go all the way to the edge. The product info is upfront about that too. But not going up to the edge means there's a perimeter of your phone that isn't protected.I had one small problem with the installation where the phone moved slightly out of position but it was caught right before I swung the screen into place, so no damage was done. But the thin plastic frames that other companies used would've completely solved this issue. That's the only reason for not giving 5 stars. Otherwise, this looks like a good protective screen for the iPhone 8.
