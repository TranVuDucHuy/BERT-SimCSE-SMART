This is now the third insta360 I've had. I had the original, then the onex, now this. I will mostly be compring it to the onex, since it is made to be the replacement for that.I REALLY like the usable screen on this camera. I can actually get the functions I need and see useful previews.The form factor is a little bigger than the previous, but close enough to call it negligible. It's a heavy little unit, but sturdy.Battery life is really good. I did 4 20 racing sessions and it outlasted them all.I do use it windsurfing and it hasn't leaked yet.The bad stuff: They say quicker wireless transfer, but that's not true in any way. It's still basically unusable for editing my longer videos unless I download them first. I might look to purchase the cable instead, and I'm not sure why they can't just include that. Maybe if you are on;y taking 2 minte videos it works, but mine are usually 15-30 minutes long, and it really bogs down.No option to automatically cut videos in to shorter sections the software can actually handle.the edge stitching leaves a lot to desire.Finally, the flat output video is still pretty low quality, especially if you try to zoom in to frame a certain thing. I was hoping for a 4k flat output from a 360 capture. Nope.Still good, would still recommend.
