I really like this headset for the purpose that I got it for, which is to have a portable headset for conference call when I am traveling. The sound quality is really good, the battery life is long enough even for long conference call, and the whole setup is extremely portable. However, I still prefer the larger wireless headset in my office. This headset is fine for a day, but it is not nearly as comfortable as an over-the-ear headset. Furthermore, the range and noise cancellation of this headset is also not as good as a full-size headset (which I don't think is a design flaw, something has to give when the physical space is more limited).
