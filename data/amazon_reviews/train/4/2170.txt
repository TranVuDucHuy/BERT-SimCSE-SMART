I've had previous Galaxy and even Jaba buds but found this to best so far. The bass is good, you can use just one and it doesn't matter which, the controls are customizable and easy to use, and the fit is decent. The con to this is that when you put noise cancellation OFF it is still extremely hard to hear anything around you. I've had music playing at a moderate and low level in my office with noise cancellation off and still couldn't hear when someone was talking to me. With the noise cancellation ON while riding the subway, it does an amazing job of blocking out the background noise of the car and rail but I've noticed it still picks up on voices near you. Of course, if you are playing music you won't hear the voices. The fit is a little iffy at least I've noticed the bean shape working it's way out of my ears if chewing gum or eating and constantly have to readjust. If just walking, I don't have to adjust it nearly as often.
