Projector worked well with my roku. It doesnâ€™t connect to Disney or Netflix . Kind of defeats the purpose of having wifi if you have to plug in your roku in order to use the projector. The Bluetooth connection feature was nice. I was able to connect it to my speakers. I ended up returning it for another one that has more features like a DVD player.
