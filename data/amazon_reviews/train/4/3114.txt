Is what you’d expect. I also have the 35mm f1.8 and 24-105 f4… hesitated to get this one for a long time, but needed something more compressed (than the 35mm) and crisper (than the 24-105) for portraits. Didn’t want the extra expense, size and weight (and closer distance limitation in small rooms) of the 85mm. This 50mm does not disappoint… and is so much more portable / comfortable than any of these other lenses mentioned. The hard-to-handle 43mm cap size & sound of the autofocus are the only annoying aspects. I just added the lens hood for a little more distance protection from things coming into contact with lens glass… and maybe avoid some lens flare when not wanted.
