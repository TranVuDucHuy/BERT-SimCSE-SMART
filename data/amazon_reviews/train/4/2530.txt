This is an amazing digital portrait of you’re on a budget!The resolution isn’t that high but it compesates by keeping image quality. It has an internal memory where you can put music, videos and pictures.Auto on and off options are easy to set up and convenient.You can just plug and transfer any files from your computer to it.The controller has to be REALLY aimed to the receptor or it won’t work.8/10 would buy again.
