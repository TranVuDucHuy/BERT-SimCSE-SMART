This drone was a great gift. My son loves it and had no trouble flying it. In flight it’s very steady and accurate for a drone of this price point. If your a beginner or novice pilot I would definitely recommend this drone. As for the cons, it has a built in camera that can be used in conjunction with a downloadable phone app, the app is supposed to allow control of the camera video and still shot of pictures and flight control using your phone instead of the dedicated controller it comes with, I did not have any luck using those functions but to be fair I didn’t give a whole lot of effort to get these features working nor did I bother to read instructions. I bought this drone mainly for flying and didn’t expect much out of the camera at this price point. I would definitely buy this again for a young pilot.
