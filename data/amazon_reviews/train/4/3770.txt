I absolutely love the photo and video quality of this camera. It was easy to pair! upThe down fall on this: Motion detection does not come as a standard feature. That’s disappointing!! In order to get this feature you have to pay for the serviceMy current camera include Motion detection as an included feature.I’m not sure that I like having to pay extra for something that should come automatic when you’re talking about a surveillance camera for home protection. Kind of defeats the purpose.If motion is not important to you, GET THIS CAMERA!!!I only gave it 4 stars due to the motion detection issue.
