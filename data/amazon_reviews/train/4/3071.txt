I can't emphasize enough how amazing this camera is coming from the very first generation of the Sony A7. I was worried whether this was worth the extra $500 versus A7M3 but after typing it out, it seems like it was. Versus the A7M3, it has...- Higher resolution photos.- More autofocus points.- Bird eye autofocus.- Better stabilization.- 4k60p vs 4k30p video.- Higher res viewfinder/LCD.- Bigger image buffer.- 5GHz WiFi support.- USB3.2 support.To each their own, but it felt like for $500 difference, that was worth it for me in the long run.Having now for about a week, I will say coming from the Sony A7 (first gen) - it's amazing on all fronts. It does feel heavier, but the bigger battery, in-body image stabilization, and other cool tech shenanigans surely have to attribute to this.Autofocus is 99% perfect; seems like in dim-light scenarios, not as great as I was hoping but it's barely off.The video looks fantastic.Love the new menu system.An amazing amount of customization. Those just beginning will definitely want to study up on YouTube for what everything does.Flip out screen is great, but I do miss the first gen's folding system a little for outdoor photography; you can of course get MORE articulation with your screen now but it just takes longer to fold out, plus it's outside of the camera body which worries me with durability in mind.The quality of the body and grip feel fine; I am tending to miss the first gen's material choices as well but I think this will grow on me.Loving the arrangement of buttons and switch choices.Performance seems stellar. I paired with dual Lexar Professional 2000x (LSD2000128G-BNNNU) and haven't had any issues.Solid thumbs up, and can't wait to use this camera for 7+ years as I did with the first-gen.
