I wouldn't use these for professional work, but for the casual user who won't move these around much, they do the job. They come with a bunch of gels as well. One caveat about the gels: they come with a plastic layer on each side that is supposed to be removed, but it's a bear to remove them (I used a razor, scraping the edge till I caught enough of the plastic, then pulled the rest off).
