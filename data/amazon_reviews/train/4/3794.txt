First impression: they're small (like opera glasses) so it'll be nice to throw it in my backpack when I hike in the woods. The problem is that (unless they're defective) the right-eye won't focus on my backyard bird feeders that are maybe 50 feet away. Seems like the closest it will focus is maybe 100 feet away, which is fine for hikes - but not for my backyard.I just bought two more. (I like them 'cause they're small.) One is defective (right eye doesn't focus) so I'm sending it back. The other seems to have a focus distance limit from, like, 100 feet (nothing closer) to maybe a couple hundred yards (nothing farther).The quality of these binoculars are definitely inconsistent.
