Seems like a good product overall other than mine arriving bent out the box and the chains could be of higher quality or at least I wouldn't care if they were all black.01/16/2021 EDIT: The company contacted me on their own volition to follow up as I just bent the brackets back and used them after writing this review. They we very professional and resolved my issue.Increasing review to 4 stars from the previously assigned 3. The product itself has been working very well for me.
