Good value. Easy to set up. Overall I'm happy with it. It's pretty close to my WiFi router so I can't comment on range, but the image quality is good. Night resolution is average. I like that you're not forced to pay to retrieve video, but find the delay in the motion sensor misses some of what I would like to have recorded. The app works well for remote viewing.
