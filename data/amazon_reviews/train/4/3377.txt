This is a very good headset in important ways:- sound quality- build quality- comfort- ease of pairing/remembering/connecting with PCHowever, for the price point and rave reviews, I am VERY disappointed in:- The useless BlueParrot button (it's "programmable" with the app -- yeah, an app -- that doesn't work). There are four buttons on this headset: volume up, volume down, power, and BP button. 25% of your buttons are useless. Why isn't that button a hard-wired "pair" button, or pause, or switch devices, or ANYTHING useful?- The spotty connection quality. I walk around my house, never more than 10M from my PC, and half the time my music cuts in and out like I'm on knockoff earbuds from 2014. For more than a Benjamin, that's dumb.- The lack of swapping between devices. After about a month, this headset just flat stopped being able to pair with my phone. Swapping seamlessly from Device 1 to Device 2 was part of the point of researching and buying this model, and it sucks at it.Overall, four stars instead of three or even two ($130 for music that cuts in and out?! Really!?) because, when it does work, the headset is amazing.-
