I bought this just in case as my 2nd gen Apple Pencil started acting up and having battery issues within less than a year of owning it. This Pencil is under $20 vs $200 for an Apple Pencil it’s a steal. It’s even magnetic so if you want the look of the 2nd gen Apple Pencil here it is. I’ll go as far as to say it feels like it’s better quality than the Apple Pencil itself. Comes with 2 extra tips and covers for the android charging port. It just skip when writing occasionally but for $20 bucks I can get past that. Honestly don’t even think about it just buy it. Truly the Apple Pencil Isn’t worth it unless you’re willing to pay $200 each year :)
