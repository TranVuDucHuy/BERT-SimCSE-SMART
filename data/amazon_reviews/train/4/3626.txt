This charger is fine if you have a phone without much of a protective case. My s10 has a Ottor Box cover that will charge but bearly, the LED flashes because it's not making good contact for charging. I learned that if you simply turn the phone upside down i.e. where the cameras lens is at the bottom, it charges just fine. Best if you use a samsung 3.0 charger. Cheers, EJ
