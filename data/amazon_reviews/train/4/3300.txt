I use this as a tv in one of my rooms. Projected onto the ceiling/wall (old house, 45 degree angle roof) it works great! the picture is clear, fire stick works wonderfully in it and the speaker gets loud enough and clear enough to use without using an external speaker. When I use this outside for movies i do connect it via bluetooth to a large speaker and there is a little audio lag. Overall this checked all my boxes and didnt break the bank. Picture is clear!
