I've purchased Reolink cameras in the past. Specifically ONVIF bullet cameras that worked okay with my Amcrest NVR. I wanted to try this to see how it works with battery/solar. The battery life is extremely good. Motion alert is triggered and received within 5 seconds. Not bad. Picture quality is okay. Camera takes a while sometimes to connect when trying to view live. I like how they provide straps. Overall not bad, just not for me. I will stick with POE cameras for better picture and quality.
