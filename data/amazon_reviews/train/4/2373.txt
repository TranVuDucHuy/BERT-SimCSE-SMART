As with any electronic, the reviews can be polarized. I have been satisfied with this camera so far! We use it as a baby monitor for my son's room. The night vision is great. The notifications can be personalized (I have it notify me for baby cries and person detection, not motion or other sounds). The range of views is great and ease of changing views is easy. I've been happy with the app too. I bought a 256GB SD card which allows us to go back and look at the camera recordings from the past. Most important thing to emphasize - with the SD card, you can go back and watch recordings without any subscription! You also get notifications without any subscription (with or without an SD card).Only reason I gave this 4 stars- you cannot leave it streaming as a baby monitor. After 10 minutes, the screen times out and asks if you want to keep streaming. With that popup, you won't hear anything. Huge design flaw if you're looking to use it as a baby monitor. We have a sound/video monitor that we used when he was an infant, so we just use that for the monitor purpose when we're sleeping. Overall very happy with the camera. We were disappointed that we couldn't stream it continuously to use as a baby monitor, but since we figured out a work around, we don't mind.
