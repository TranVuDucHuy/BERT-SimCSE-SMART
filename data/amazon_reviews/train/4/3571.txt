I got this extender. It works perfectly fine. But it doesn’t extend completely from the power socket to my bed. I’m 5’10” and need to stretch a bit weirdly to use my charger at night.If only I had listened to my mum and worked on increasing my height, I’d be 6’, with this extender reaching perfectly at night and all the beautiful shallow girls would look up to me.For now I’m a single person, who’s 5’10” and has to bend weirdly to reach his phone charger so I can get swiped left by girls every night.
