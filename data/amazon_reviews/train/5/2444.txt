This cable had taken some serious damage while i had it i plugged it into my living room tv and after a while it never lost any kind of resolution or quality and i only say so not becasue of a matter of time but that and becasue when we moved i found out how much damage it had actually taken the stand it was on had it pinned againt the wall completely crushed and parallel to itself going back next to itself as well as both cable ends being completely bent at 45 angles and being covered in various apilled liquids as well as candle wax dust that get all like oily and nasty we have cats and they attacked the crap out of them but aside from aome light scratches thwy were fine and after moving and undoing the cable and cleaning it you could barely tell how beat up they were.
