Replaced a customers 3 VGA cables with HDMI (yes, someone had his monitors wired badly) and what a HUGE difference ... and picked these 10' cables since they were good price, ends looks good, and like braided ... all were great, I use TONS of HDMI and other cables and hate poor quality, highly recommend these.
