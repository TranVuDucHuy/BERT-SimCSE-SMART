I purchased an original set of these a few years back that had an open case and they held up through the time. My 12 year old son discovered how nice they made the bass in songs sound and how the cord is integrated into the case (SO NICE) so he ran off with them and I purchased a new set with the lid to the case. He got ear buds for Christmas from his aunt and still kept using the Jlab originals because the sound quality is so much better and you can adjust the bass and he hated having to find a cord and block to charge his new ones.Being the originals are now a few years old I got him a new set in another color as the ones I just purchased myself and he keeps telling his friends how awesome they are and hasn't touched the ones from his aunt since they came!
