same day delivery and simple install.. needed a 1/2‚Äù socket wrench to drive lag screws into woods frame.. good quality hardware.. worth mentioning the paper stencil is smaller than the actual product.. if spacing is tight, measure with mount to confirm more space is required before building additional support.. very happy overall
