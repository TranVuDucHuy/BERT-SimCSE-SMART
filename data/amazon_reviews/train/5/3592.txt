Was the officially licensed animal crossing one. I forgot to take a photo but came in the packaging and was shipped with extreme care. Debated not opening it for collectors sake even. HahaBut I got it on a Black Friday sale. Shipped faster than estimated and arrived almost a month early even. Was perfect and increased my switches memory 10 fold. Would recommend if running out of room for your gaming needs.
