I've enjoyed my Brother laser printer for years, and I usually buy genuine toner cartridges for it. This twin pack of high-yield cartridges is the way to go. The print quality is great, they last a relatively long time (depending on your use), and the price is better when bought as a twin pack. I'm getting thousands of pages out of each cartridge, and I am happy with how long they last and the quality of print. Just be sure to clean your corona wire of the drum kit every once in a while to keep the printing clean and sharp.
