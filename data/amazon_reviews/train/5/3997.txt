I don't know much about tripods... but I believe this is the perfect starter tripod for beginners.The tripod itself can be condensed to a small stick, small enough to fit in any average sized backpack. The locking mechanism to open up the tripod was a bit tricky at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to open the tripod in a matter of seconds. I really enjoy the locking mechanism because it allows me to set the legs at any width (which helps if the area I'm filming in is very narrow).The tripod can extend to be about 5ft tall which is tall enough for filming overviews on a desk. I am currently using a Canon M50 Mark ii and I can place the camera comfortably on the tripod, at the highest height, face it downwards, and still be confident enough that it won't tip over.The tripod came with a phone holder that extends to hold virtually any phone (I currently have an iPhone SE) and it also came with a Bluetooth remote which I only used once, but it was very easy to set up after reading the instructions.I hope this review can help someone who may be on the line about buying a tripod. It's priced fairly for the build and quality, and it's even perfect for holding the phone during a video call.
