This is my second blue yeti microphone. I’ve been podcasting for 3 years and my old mic was ready to retire. I didn’t even bother looking around for other mics as I love the quality and versatility of the blue yeti!Fan for life because y’all make me sound great! 🎙️Big Love,Chelsea HoldenCups Chels Podcast
