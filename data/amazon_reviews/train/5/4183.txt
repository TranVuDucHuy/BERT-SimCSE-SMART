The tv side bracket fit perfectly on my tv without needing to use the included add on brackets. The supplied bolts fit perfectly and there are many left over since they supplied lots of different ones for different applications. The supplied lag screws were perfect for my installation (Rock lath and plaster over wood stud). The adjustable tilt is great for the viewing angle I needed. And the price is good for a sturdy mount. I definitely recommend this mount.
