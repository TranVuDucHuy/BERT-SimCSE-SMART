This product is great! We have family across the us and we are able to share pictures of grandkids/grand dogs. The app is so easy to use. To be connected to many frames at one time our family currently has 8 that everyone can share pictures with just a few clicks. I also like the fact it will share short videos also. The audio works to! Really nice.2-negatives1-if u have old pictures or pictures you no longer care to see you have to manually delete each pic from the frame2-whenever it is touched or lightly bumped it turns off and has to go threw the whole reset process and it takes at least 3 mins to load
