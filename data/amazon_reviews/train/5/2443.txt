Disappointingly one of the HDMI ports on my TV broke and I only had two to begin with so I recently purchased an HDMI switcher that I can plug into my one good port left and still be able to plug-in multiple devices. However I thought that the switcher that I bought came with an HDMI cord that would plug into the TV and into the small switcher box. Unfortunately it did not but I found this cord. It’s made out of wonderful material it seems like it’s strong and flexible and durable it is very small but that’s what I want it anyway I didn’t want a large long cord draping from the back of my TV so this works for exactly what I wanted it to.
