I couldn't get the remote shutter to work which was upsetting. But then I found on the side that there was a tiny off/on button. I turned it on and then had no problem linking it to my iPhone. My package didn't come with any instructions. I wouldn't have freaked out about the remote if I could have read about the off/on switch in a set of instructions.I'm pleased that I figured out how to use this tripod for document copying with the document flat on a table.It's sturdier than I had expected for a $20 tripod. It's sturdy enough for my purposes.Overall, this is a very good product and I'm glad I bought it.
