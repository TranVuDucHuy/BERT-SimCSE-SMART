Plug in, turn on, wait until READY light is on. (hot plastic smell but itâ€™s probably from being new) Put sheet into laminating pouch, start into machine squarely. Laminator turns on and pulls pouch into machine. Hardly any noise at all. Laminated sheet comes out. No issues. Selectable 3 or 5 mil heat setting. Release switch if something gets stuck.I have used larger, heavier laminators at work: heat up, watch gauge for proper temperature, put sheet into to laminator pouch, then into a cardboard carrier, then switch machine to run, run it through, extract sheet from paper carrier. I suppose this method gives very even heat, but it laborious.
