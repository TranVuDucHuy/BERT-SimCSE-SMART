What is there to say about a genuine Apple UBC C charge cable. Don't risk damaging your MacBook battery with non apple chargers or cables. Yes, power adapters and USB cables make a difference especially when they are charging cables.If you want 100% compatibility and performance spend the extra for genuine Apple cables. Save money elsewhere, don't shorten the battery life of your Apple devices.If you don't believe there is a difference, purchase an inexpensive USB tester/power meter and see if your power adapters and cables are producing the claimed amperage and voltage. You'll see that genuine products will produce what they claim and your devices will charge faster. Inexpensive cables and chargers will most often not produce the claimed voltage or amperage resulting in longer charge tines and damage to the battery.Yes, the cable had a manufacturing smell when the box was first opened but fully dissipated within a few minutes.I don't know why some reviewer are claiming it's not a real Apple product. This cable is from the Apple Store and looks and feels 100% genuine. I am confident that It's a genuine Apple cable.They never go on sale. If you don't want any issues, spend the extra for them.
