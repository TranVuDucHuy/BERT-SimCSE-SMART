First, I have several of these Belkin surge protectors and they work great. No complaints whatsoever. However, the latest one I purchased through Amazon warehouse was advertised as "Like New" and the item/carton was far from that. The carton was torn to shreds and just in terrible shape. The prongs on the actual surge protector were all pointed to the right like it had been stepped on or something similar. I am very disappointed in what Amazon considers "Like New" after this experience. I was able to bend back the prongs and get the surge protector plugged in but I wonder if the prongs are weaker than usual because of being bent in one direction and back the other way. Please try & do a better job of checking the worn merchandise at Amazon going forward so future customers are not so disappointed.
