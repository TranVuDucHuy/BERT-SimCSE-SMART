Used this to hook my iPad mini 6 to a Samsung TU8000 smart TV. Worked for some things, better on my dad’s new Samsung Galaxy (not sure which one, S22 maybe?). For YouTube, you can’t adjust the picture quality of you’re device on AirPlay (or at least I couldn’t). I was stuck with 360p. For Disney Plus, AirPlay was not supported, period, everything updated too. For my dads phone, everything worked and in HD too (1080p I think, not sure but it worked way better, internet speed may have limited it from higher resolutions). It also worked with his laptop for everything as well. The product worked great, my device not so much.
