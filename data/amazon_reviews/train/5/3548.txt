HP cartridges last the longest. They are the original ink cartridge and still better than ay other brands I have tried. They last longer and Prime gets them here quickly. They give a sharper print quality and are super easy to install. Also being able to order them using Amazon Prime saves me going to the store and hoping they are on the shelf. Barbara Fulkerson
