Fingerprint is hit or miss... Works better when your fingers are not dry. Been using the phone for key a week and works great for day to day use... Not using for gaming or streaming. Doesn't get hot while in use or charging (using with a case). Battery lasts me all day. I don't regret not getting the pro version, smaller footprint than the pro so it fits better in my hand and saved me $250 (this was $485 on sale vs the 7pro which was $735 on sale).One thing to mention is that there have been reports of the camera glass shattering without impact/falling (could be due to change in temperature going from room temp to cold temperatures outside)
