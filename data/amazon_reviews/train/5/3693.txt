My old driving camera was shut down for no reason, and also pump up the words” SD card read technically wrong” I searched online, because my old card was too low speed to read as well as very old need replaced.So I brought 32GB high speed one, restart my camera, that fix my problem well. Nice! Very recommended if your camera same issues. 👍
