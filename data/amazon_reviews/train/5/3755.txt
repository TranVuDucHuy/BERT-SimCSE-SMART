Edit after 2 months: There is a review from IGN that mentions that some games use the iPhone's haptic feedback for vibrations. But this is not true for PS Remote Play. This controller is fine for Remote Play as long as you aren't playing a game that requires motion controls either. Disappointed that Backbone didn't work more with Sony to get vibrations and motion control for this.I use this for PlayStation remote play, Steam link, and Apple Arcade. I was using a DualSense controller before this which is great but the weight of everything wasn’t ideal.Pros:-Very comfortable and I can easily play for hours in bed-Works across all platforms I use it for-*Can be used as a wired controller (requires their subscription service to use this feature)-Long press of the Backbone button works as the PS buttonCons:-Can’t use this with a case on your phone-No vibration motors which I’ve come to expect in a controller that is $100.Edit: IGN claims that certain apps from the appstore will use the phone's haptic feedback for vibrations. PS Remote Play does not have this though.-Not as easy to use as the DualSense or DualShock 4 because of the touch pad. You’ll find yourself tapping the screen a few times to use this feature.-No motion controls for PS Remote PlayI really do love this controller. Their subscription service is really geared toward people that want to easily record and stream their games from their phone. Which is cool but I’m not one of those people. It’s weird to me that the ability to use this as a wired controller for your MacBook and such is locked behind that subscription service though. I’d rather just plug in a different controller than pay $40/year for just that feature.
