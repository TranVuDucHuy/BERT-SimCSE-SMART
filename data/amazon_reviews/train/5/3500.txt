I am actually impressed with this micro sd card and it never occurred to me I would be hearing myself say that.I avoid a certain popular brand of sd cards because over the years I had to replace them too many times. I even lost everything on one at one point.I had purchased that brand's "high endurance" card for my dash cam and it stopped working within a week. No more!!! The heat is brutal in West Texas.I switched to the Samsung High Endurance for the dash cam and it has been working flawlessly so I decided to go Samsung again for my phone (which is not a Samsung). ðŸ™‚Well, I have noticed a difference in the speed at which my photos copy over to this one over any other I've had in the past.Again, I'm no expert but so far so good. If things change, I'll edit this review.Thank you for reading.
