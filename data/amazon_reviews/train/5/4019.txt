I use this in my kitchen when reading recipes or on the dining table or desk when doing paperwork. It's movable, adjustable, sturdy and the height works well enough for face recognition pages. I have the new iPhone 14 plus .. the bigger screen .. holds in place perfectly without tilting or wobbling .. no skid bottom keeps solid in place wherever you put it.
