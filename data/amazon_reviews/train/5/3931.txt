When you have a spectacular reputation, it has to deliver or the trust the public in the brand's name will be tarnished, and this product delivers. I popped it in my Switch, formatted it, and re-downloaded all my 80GB of games and this little (big 512GB) card delivered as advertised. Amazon, as always on time, and secured. There were other cards with lower prices, but do you really want to trust all the money you spent on digital games, and the hours of gameplay on a "cheap" no-name brand? I don't think so. My Nintendo Switch memory card was and is currently a SAMSUNG. Hope this little review helped :)
