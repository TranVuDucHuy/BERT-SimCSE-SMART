My Wife and I use Apple Chargers a lot since we both have iPhones and iPads. I needed to replace the car charger we had and this was an OEM replacement cable from Apple. It charges just like the last one did and it was $16, which is a bit pricey, but I wanted to keep with an OEM cable because sometimes the non-OEM ones don't fit my iPhone with the case I have on it, so I paid the premium price for the Apple one.It does the job like the last OEM one I've had and after 5-months or so it's still looking brand new. The last cable last about 5-years or so before it started to fray and that's when I decided to buy this new one. Buy this if you need an OEM replacement.
