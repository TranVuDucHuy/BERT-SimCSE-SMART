I've hung a lot of TVs on walls but this is the easiest mount I've ever used. It seems really sturdy and secure, I did use 4" long construction screws as I was going thru 1.5" of fake stone, Hardy board and drywall before I even reached the stud but it went up easily. I did grab the neighbor to help me lift the TV onto the mount as it was about shoulder high for me but if it had been lower or I younger I could have done it completely by myself. The range of motion is an extra bonus!
