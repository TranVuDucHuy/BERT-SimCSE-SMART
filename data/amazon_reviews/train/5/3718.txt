Not my first time purchasing an SD card from Amazon, but it is my first time purchasing the 1TB model. It arrived in convincing packaging, and I tested it with h2testw on my PC to make sure it wasn't a counterfeit.[A small PSA for those unaware]Counterfeit SD cards DO exist and there are often customers on Amazon that will end up with one. This is in large part due to the fact that they are near-identical to the original cards and with Amazon working with many third-party sellers, their inventories get merged and the fakes often slip into the bunch.Fake cards that are supposedly 1TB in size will also lie to your computer. They will display as 1TB in size, but it's actually a much smaller card(64GB for instance) that will auto-delete your data once it passes the limit(64 GB as the example).This is why I recommend h2testw which will fill your card up to test the write speeds, verify it all to test the read speeds, and ensure the advertised SD card size is accurate.Also if you are using it for Steam Deck, Switch, or really ANY device. Your advertised 1TB Card will show up as about 953GB, or 400GB will show 366. That's NORMAL. The extra GB that were eaten up is for formatting your card to the appropriate device and ensuring everything within it is readable. And since SD card manufacturers like SanDisk can't accurately measure it on all devices, they use 400GB or 1TB as a size option.[PSA over]Another thing to note. SanDisk will usually have something like "Speeds up to 150MB/s" on the packaging for example. Normally you will not reach those speeds unless you have their special SD adapter to reach those speeds.My 1TB Ultra has a read/write speed average of 25MB/s with an average adapter. It is slow for filling up 1TB but I personally do not mind. If you are not as patient, opt for the SanDisk Extreme and test it with h2testw to be safe.Overall mine is an authentic card, but remember to test your cards and do proper research before assuming it's a fake.
