I think this phone by far is the best bang for your buck if you are an Android user and looking for a solid experience with great price for the value this phone provides. Another great point of this phone is the fact that it comes with no unwanted app which you have to deal with when you buy a 1 plus or Samsung phone, Great experience using Google AI and vanilla. Android is the top selling points when I wanted to buy my pixel 7 and last but not least, this phone has one of the best picture quality when it comes to the camera. Also worth mention that this great experience does not need any tweaks or crazy menus to deal with, The list will go on and on but I want to stop here since I have a lot to love about this phone
