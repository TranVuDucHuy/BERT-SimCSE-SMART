I’ve been so terrified of buying these 1TB Sandisk due to horror stories of fake vs real. The crazy posts of threads about bad cards frying up inside Nintendo Switch and laptops. I have been buying the official Nintendo cards due to these fears but always on sale never full price! Got a Steam Deck couple months ago and needed a 1TB so I chanced it!Compared the one for Nintendo from Sandisk to the ones I received and they all matched. Green backing where you can almost make out the card circuits and a black label for identification and where it’s made. The cardboard wasn’t a pain to open but the plastic where it houses the sd card and provided reader was a pain!After observing the cards from thread posts of those reporting overheating causing melted cards inside Nintendo Switch and laptops, I realized those cards all had full black backing no visual of the circuits at all. Turns out the one from both threads both OP later reported the cards fakes. So be careful, check them physically, run speed tests or for security call Sandisk customer service for help.Always buy from Amazon directly for better coverage! I got lucky and all of mine 6 cards to be exact, all on different Switches and 2 Steam Decks work! Zero issues and been using them regularly. Very happy with the storage especially now with holiday sales and being able to have all digital stuff ready on devices.Don’t buy these at full retail price, wait for sales like Prime Days or Black Friday/Cyber Monday! You can get 2 for the price of one during those days! Keep them on a wishlist so you see updates on discounts!
