This is a convenient all in one charger. I’ve been through a few and this is definitely one of the better ones.Pros:- no trying to guess the sweet spot for charging like lay flat chargers have- you can still charge flat if you want as well- works as a good nightstand mode to see the time- can charge all the things- it folding flat and the fact that it’s just a usb c plug made traveling really easy. Going to bring this on my trips from now on.Cons- I have an iPhone 14 pro max and it’s big enough that it’s easy to knock the watch off if you’re not careful- I don’t really understand the glowing light on the base BUT you can turn it off which is great- the piece for standing it up doesn’t really feel very secure, it’s a little lip the leg gets caught on. I knocked it over one time by reaching for my phone a bit too hard in the night. An easy improvement would be if it clicked in. With that said it’s not really a big problem, just something I noticed.I liked it enough to go and buy one for my wife as well.
