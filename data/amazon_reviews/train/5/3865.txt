Been in the music scene for a good long minute and the first pro audio company I heard of was Blue Microphones and it was for good reason.That same reason is why this microphone is the one you see YouTubers use the most (next to the shure sm7b) and why it’s been the #1 best selling usb mic for years now.Is it the best audio? No.Is it the worse audio? No.Is it budget friendly? Yes (to an extent)Is it professional sounding? Yes. Yes. Yes.Is it easy to learn and use? Yes.Is it good quality? Yes.Will it last? Yes.Is it worth the investment? Yes and No.Should I buy one? Yes and No.It’s a workhorse microphone that will be there for years to come and perform the same every single time. It just depends on the work load it’s given.This is an amateur friendly and pro grade microphone however it’s still $100 and that’s a serious investment if you’re not serious about putting it to work.If you’re a podcaster, singer-songwriter, YouTuber, musician, rapper, voice-over actor, streamer, product reviewer and/or social media influencer then YES most definitely get one.If you’re a hobbyist, or someone who’s unsure if they need one then No. Don’t get one. It’s better to start off with a much cheaper option that still has a great sound like the Blue Snowball or others of the same price tag.
