If you're thinking about buying a pair of great over-ear headphones without jumping on the air max "trendy" bandwagon, then you found them. These are FANTASTIC. I have used these every day since buying them 5 months ago - at the gym, at home, for work calls, etc. and they have met all my expectations. The noise canceling is fantastic, almost too good sometimes. The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them). I wear them to the gym to weightlift and sweat a normal amount, and have had no issues so far. Might not be something you want to do intense jumping or HIIT workouts in, since they do move around a bit - but that goes for ALL over ear headphones. Running with them on was no problem.When looking to make an investment in a pair of headphones I went in-person to Best Buy and tried these compared to the Apple Air Max and these won by a long shot. Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the "it-girl" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better. Only thing I agree with is they are a finger-print magnet but be good about cleaning your devices and its not an issue. The volume control / change song features on the ear cups is also something that takes some getting use to but I use my phone or apple watch to change those settings anyways so I don't find it to be an issue that impacts its quality.Overall, would recommend to anyone.
