My kids are always watching their phones or playing games. When they eat a snack, they are allowed to have their phones but the problem was that they had nothing to prop them on. These little stands are sturdy and super simple. Clear acrylic is so so sleek and clean looking. They love this this and if it gets a little dirty from food or anything then can wash with some soap. Donâ€™t scrub just use your hands.
