I recently upgraded my kids to the iPhone 13, and needed to purchase this adapter. I was worried that it would be easily lost being so small, but it plugs in securely to the phone and holds the plug on their earpods securely. Sound quality is very good. Just can't believe this is needed to listen to corded headphones now. Money grab by these companies! What use to come free, built into phones, we now pay them money for the same option to listen to music.Don't get me started on the charging blocks that aren't included! LolAnyways, it's a great cord, get it!
