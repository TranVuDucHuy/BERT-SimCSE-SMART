bought this cable as a link between my new Dell laptop and my Asus 24" monitor. Every now and then, the monitor would blink off and move my windows over to my laptop. I read that the cable probably wasn't rated for 4K monitors. I decided to give this one a try as it was reasonably priced and came in different lengths. I received it and switched the cables out. No issues so far so I believe that solved the problem.
