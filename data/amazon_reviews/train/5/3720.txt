You get a little less than 1tb of storage, but that is true with all micro sd cards. Did not need a fast card, just a card that could hold all of my music, photos videos and movies on my Samsung Note 20 Ultra. I would have purchased a Samsung card, but they don't make a 1tb version. SanDisk is a reputable company so it was easy to choose this card. Be careful of no-name companies who offer the same with cheap prices...they do not work!
