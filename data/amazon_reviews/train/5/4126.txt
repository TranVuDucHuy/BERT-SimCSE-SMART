I’m always apprehensive ordering headphones, as I’m very icky about sound quality, but I needed something to help block out the sound of the dryers and barking (I’m a groomer) and these did amazing. I wouldn’t say the sound was totally blocked out (but that’s a hefty feat anyhow), but it did help reduce the noise, protect my hearing, while allowing me to listen to a nice podcast with decent sound quality. I am a huge fan of the led screen display on the charging case. Previous headphones I’ve had in the past did not have this feature, so it was a guessing game to see if they were charged on not. With these, it tells you the charge of the pieces, as well as the case itself which is pretty neat. Definitely recommend
