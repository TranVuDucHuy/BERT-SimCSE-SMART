Best investment I've made in video conferencing. It's so easy to setup and use my 8 year old can do it. The Owl Labs is lightweight, sits on the middle of conference table and has 360 rotation, mic and speaker system so that everyone in the room is part of the conference call with everyone else who is remote. Sound is crystal clear, video is crisp, and it works with any type of conference call - Zoom, Teams, Skype, etc... The best part is, you can easily move it from one meeting to the next. We love it so much, we actually travel with it and setup it up in client meetings. Definitely worth the investment.
