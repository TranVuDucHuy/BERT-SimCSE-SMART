My job had me transition from an iMac 2017 to an iMac M1 2021 desktop computer. The Logitech headset and plug-in mouse I use both are USB. The back of an iMac M1 2021 only has USB-C ports. I was so worried I'd have to buy a whole new headset and plug-in mouse until I saw this adapter on Amazon. It was very simple to use. I just plugged this adapter into the back of my iMac and then plugged my headset into the adapter and my iMac detected my headset right away. Now I can keep doing my job and not have to waste money on new accessories.
