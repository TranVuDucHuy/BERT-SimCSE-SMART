I'm the type of person who must have wireless earbuds or neckbands with me everyday. They have become a top need during the work days of the week. Having read the reviews, I purchased them 3 days ago and have enjoyed using them.______________________________________________Comfortable "on the ear"Battery life is really good.Strong amount of Bass blocking out the outside noise.No difficulty receiving or hearing incoming calls, messages or notifications.Cons:The earbuds were disconnecting my calls a few times. I reasoned with the possibility it could have been that I didn't charge it (out of the box new devices has a 50% charge) after having used it for about an hour.Not a fan of the hard plastic case felt sort of cheapI still believe these are great earbuds and would buy again in the future.
