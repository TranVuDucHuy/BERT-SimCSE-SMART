I liked this so much I bought 2 more. I have in the past replaced the receptacle itself to get both USB and 110v 3 prong plugs, however I find that you the 110v plugs block the USB outlets so you have to unplug something to use the USB charge points, that is NOT the case here. You can plug in 5 110v plugs, 3 USB devices and 1 USB0C device at that same time without any interference ( provided you don't overload the circuit. I cant speak for the surge protection, but I keep this next to my bed to keep cell phone / wireless home phone, clock, lamp etc. all in one receptacle. It does protruded unlike the actual receptacles, but you dont have the hassle of installation to contend with nor trying to cram the large component and wires into the small wall opening. For the price this is a great purchase. They have been working flawlessly for months.
