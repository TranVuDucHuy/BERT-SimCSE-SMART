I've been using the SanDisk 128GB Extreme Pro SD card for years now, and it's always been my go-to choice for high-performance memory storage. The write speed on this card is lightning fast, and it very rarely has to catch up to my Canon EOS R, even when shooting in burst mode.One of the things I appreciate most about this card is the value for money. It's significantly less expensive than some of the other high-end options on the market, but it performs just as well, if not better. It's a real bang for your buck, especially considering that I've been using it for years with no issues.I've tried other cards in the past, but I always end up coming back to the SanDisk 128GB Extreme Pro. It's reliable, consistent, and just a pleasure to use.Overall, if you're in the market for a high-performance SD card, you really can't go wrong with the SanDisk 128GB Extreme Pro. It's quick, reliable, and offers great value for money.
