I bought these so I could use my power bank to charge my Surface Pro 7 and my Samsung Galaxy S9+ since it requires USB Type C to USB Type C.The two cables easily handle charging my Surface Pro 7 and Galaxy S9+. They are sturdy with their woven interlocked sleeve and are an in-ostentatious black and gray which I appreciate since many woven sleeve cords tend to be brightly colored.In addition to allowing my power bank to charge my devices, they also make great data cables for transferring files to-and-from my computers to my phone. If you have a USB Type C connector on the front panel of your PC or the side of your laptop, these can help bridge the connection between your phone and computer.If you are having difficulty charging your devices from a power bank or wall charger while using these cords, check the Watts, Amps, and Voltage requirements for your device. These cables will support all types of USB Type C chargers up to 100W, but cannot deliver any more power than your bank or wall charger is rated. Also, keep in mind that these are USB 2.0 and NOT 3.0, which means that data transfer rates will be less than a standard USB Type A to USB Type C connector using USB 3.0. If this is confusing, just know that at best this should be able transfer 480Mbps (60 Megabytes per second).In conclusion, it's the type of high quality I've come to expect from Anker and it's what I needed.
