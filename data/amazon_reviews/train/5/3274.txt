I was merely expecting to receive a cheap DVI cable to get the job done and I was pleasantly surprised. I have no complaints - it works as advertised on one of my 144hz monitors and the price is great considering the quality of the cabling.The cable itself is nicely braided, flexible, and the ends are solid and well attached. The quality speaks volumes about the company and I'm actually tempted to buy another cable or two for some other monitors I have sitting around still using HDMI - If nothing else, iVANKY has definitely earned a return customer.
