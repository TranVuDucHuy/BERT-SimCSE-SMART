These are beautiful. They're my baby. I love them. I put my baby on and all the sudden, the world around me is gone. My engaged roommate (who falls asleep on the phone with her every night), bam, gone. PTSD from having a hit put on me and being hunted, bam, gone. I'm in a really safe space now. But seriously, I treat these these way better than I'd treat a child. Least the way I was treated. Awesome headphones.Download the app and play with the EQ, it can and does get better. Gorgeous. You're a beautiful person and loved by many others, always remember. I have no regrets spending a ridiculous amount of money on these.Anyways, I hope you're okay. If you're not pm me. Or even if you are, pm me. I'd recommend these headphones. They're precious. My baby.
