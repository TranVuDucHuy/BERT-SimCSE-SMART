this things way too easy to break the mic itself is really nice and has good sound quality but the connector that you plug into your phone breaks literally so easily its really annoying and such a waste because of how fragile it is, if your doing this for podcast or very delicate purposes i think its great but if your trying to mic up or just clumsy this is 100% not it
