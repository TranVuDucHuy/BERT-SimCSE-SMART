I have always had Windows laptops that had usb ports so everything I use is usb port. My laptop didn’t want to turn on anymore so I bought a new one. Didn’t realize it only had usb-c ports until after I got home and set it up. Needed to use my usb devices so I searched for an adapter that would work. Found this one. Have used it about 3 times and so far it has been working. I am able to use all my usb devices with no problems. Looks to me like good quality that would last a long time.
