I love this wireless charger!! I was looking for something to charger all my devices fast and not have millions of cords next to my bed. I constantly was tangling my chargers, it looked messy, and I was sick of it. So purchased this wireless charger! It charges my iPhone 13, Apple Watch, and Airpod Pros super fast and well! I’ve had types of gadgets like this in the past and it would be super slow and something would not charge but not with this one. Will be buying one for my husband since he steals mine at times! And not only I use it for home, I took it on my honeymoon instead of have 3 cords and adapters and this made packing super easy and doesn’t take up much room! def buy this!!
