Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of Apple products. I have a windows-based desktop computer, an Android based cell phone...but I needed an iPad, not just any brand of tablet. Mainly I need it to store PDF files that I can't store on the cloud for security reasons. If only there were a way to easily transfer files from my Windows computer to an Apple iPad. I've done it before but it was awkward and cumbersome. However, Apple has made some improvements over the years and instead of making everything proprietary, they caved and finally included a normal port on an iPad, a USB-C port. Now...if only I could attach a USB flash drive to my iPad, a drive filled with all kinds of files from my computer. Now I can! Thanks to this USB to USB-C adapter, my iPad has become useful. This little device is awesome. I can plug in a flash drive to this adapter, plug the other end into the only port Apple allows its users to have and...presto! I have hundreds of files at my disposal when I need them and I don't have to follow any of Apple's weird ways of transferring files between iOS, Android and Windows systems. Not only that but there are two adapters included in the package. I don't leave a lot of Amazon reviews but when I find something worth writing about, I do it. And this is one of those times.
