Hi, Gang.I don't have lots to say about this Cat 6 Ethernet Cable 15 ft, Outdoor&Indoor 10Gbps Support Cat7 Network, Flat Internet RJ45 unit. Purchased it for extending my Dynalink WiFi 6 AX3600 Router. That blame T-mobile Internet unit is real picky about where I have to set it in order to pickup the best signal. But I needed the router placed further away than the six foot allotted by the included Dynalink cable.Thus, I wen with this 15' Cat 6 patch line. Works like a charm. And with the Dynalink connected, my T-mobile home system is now capable of connecting to my external motion cameras. PS. The download on my downstairs computers are also testing nearly twist as quick as before. Not that I gained connection speed on the Internet. It's just full speed from further away.Switching from the included six foot Dynalink cable to this new 15 footer makes no reduction in the Dynalink performance and permits me to direct drive my upstairs server.It's a good buy.
