I have 20-30 SanDisk memory cards for my pro photography and various other memory card needs (dash cams!). I have been using them since my early digital days around 2000 and the old smart media cards. I have never had an issue with the SanDisk cards. This one went into a new dash cam I got and it loaded right up and works great. I did a speed test on it prior to installation for reference purposes.SanDisk is ALWAYS Recommended!
