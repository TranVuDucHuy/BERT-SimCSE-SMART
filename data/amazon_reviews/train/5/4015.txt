talk about a game changer! easiest set up EVER! it comes with the tools you need too and the set up is sooo quick, i was actually shocked! i would recommend this to anyone! perfect for drawing on the ipad, and facetiming on your phone or for zoom calls, going on live, or watching videos- i mean the list goes ON! also good for multitasking on a work space desk. I wasn't sure if it would handle the ipad's weight but NO ISSUES!
