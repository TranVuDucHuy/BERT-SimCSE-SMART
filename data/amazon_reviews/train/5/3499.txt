If a smart phone accepts 64GB microSD card, it will accept up to 2TB card. This one works great in my LG G7 ThinQ. But it should work in any phone/tablet that accepts at least 64GB MicroSD cards. The file system is the same, exfat, or 64-bit FAT.It's pretty fast, reliable, but always make a backup. Just connect the phone to your pc, and it should show up in 'My Computer'. Then, copy all the files on the SD card to your hard drive/SSD. Don't copy the Android directory. IPhone I'm not sure how to do it. It might be cloud only.But Apple looks like it's not long for this world. It sells about 100,000 mobile devices/year, while Samsung sells 4x that, and Samsung is only 1 of 100 companies making Android phones. Android devices make up over 1/2 of all internet-connected devices, and that includes routers, servers, desktops, laptops, smart phones, tablets, smart watches, single-board computers, embedded systems, kitchen appliances, HDTVs, cable boxes, networking appliances and firewalls, Cray supercomputers, Compaq Tandem, IBM S360 and z series, ARM-32 and 64-bit, Qualcomm SoCs, and a host of other computing devices.Android has over 50% of the overall computing/communication market. By comparison, Microsoft Windows has 22%, and MacOS and iOS have 16%. Android is Linux, so Linux has about 80% of the internet-connected computing market. 60% of the the Internet infrastructure runs on Linux.
