Got the TOZO A1 primarily to use with my Nintendo Switch. Works great with the Switch…pairs with easily and stays connected, no problem. Didn’t intend to use for music, but turns out these value-priced buds work fantastic listening to music on my iPhone. Sure, they’re not as good as Sony WF1000XM4 or Apple AirPods Pro, but for less-than-$20 these easily outperform original Airpods. Other positives: USB C charging, a small/pocketable case, and decent battery life. These are pretty small, but not teensy-tiny…about the same size as Beats Studio Buds (sound a lot like them, too; but doesn’t have nearly as much bass presence as the Beats). The only negative I have is the “non-standard” size of the included eartip. It’s about half the size of other buds. And there’s only one size included (I’d estimate the size to be medium), no smaller or larger sizes are included with the package. In summary, the A1 is a great value, good sounding option for anyone looking for decent set of backup or low-cost primary earbuds.
