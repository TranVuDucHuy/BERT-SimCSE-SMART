LOVE this headset! I do audiobook narration, and my previous gaming Razer headset creaked and croaked terribly, which was easily picked up by my sensitive AT2020 mic. I was stuck using Apple earbuds until I was able to snag this baby, and man... it's wonderful. I originally thought the headset was over-the-ear, but they do set ON the ear -- which is my only complaint, since I wear blue-light blocking computer glasses, and the headset starts to hurt my ears where they're caught between the headset and the glasses... it starts to pinch a little. But otherwise, such a great headset! The sound quality is *chef's kiss* amazing. LOVE that it comes with two different audio plugs as well, so I don't need my adapter for my Scarlett Solo interface anymore. Highly recommend!!!
