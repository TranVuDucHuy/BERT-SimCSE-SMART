The little adhesive rubber “feet” that come with it are perfect for nonslip grip. It’s the perfect size for my phone, which is the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I like clear acrylic accessories because they’re both lightweight which makes them portable, yet see-through, which reduces visual clutter.Since I have the largest iPhone 14, it’s also the heaviest, so I feel the stand could be a *little* more sturdy. But I think that it still works really well. In fact, I think I might go back and buy one or two more. I have a hybrid work schedule now, so it would be nice to have one at the office as well as one at home in several locations.
