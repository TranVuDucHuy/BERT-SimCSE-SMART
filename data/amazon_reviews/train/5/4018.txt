This cellphone/iPad stand is sturdy and I enjoy it. I often have to take my cases off my gadgets, but it’s so worth it. It’s a great height as well.It’s simple and effective. There is also a hook behind to put a finger through, that can help you with carrying it safely, from area to another. I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.
