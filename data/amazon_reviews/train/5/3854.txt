I wear these headphones mostly at work, and they have an excellent battery life. I'll charge them like once a week, listen to them for like 3 or 4 hours a day. So like, 15-20 hours of podcasts / music. Control buttons work great. They connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time, so it's easy to use audible / spotify on my phone and then swap to youtube or a training video on my laptop. Super convenient feature. They fold up super conveniently for storage also. If I crushed them when they were folded, I don't think they'd break because of how they fold. Overall, great design. I've had a number of BT headsets that I just pushed in the wrong direction just a little bit and they snapped, these have held up for a 2 months of pretty rough use.
