First of this thing is huge, heavy and impressively well made, especially for the price. Great sound quality of recordings. I talk just a few inches from the MIC with the gain up fairly high and it sounds great. I stand it on a box on a table to get it to the right height others may want to mount it on an adjustable arm mount or something if they are going to use it all the time. Overall a great product that has improved my videos.
