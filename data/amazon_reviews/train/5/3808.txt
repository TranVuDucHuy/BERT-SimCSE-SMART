UPDATE: Upgrading rating from 2 stars to 5 stars. After I posed the review below, the company reached out to me and offered to send me new replacement cords or to refund my purchase. Since I had already purchased replacement cords, I took the refund. If I need more cords in the future, I'll definitely buy them from Anker as their customer service is top notch!Original review: 5 months after purchasing this cord, it stopped charging my MacBook air. I thought the problem was with the computer, but when I took it in for service, they connected a charging cable of theirs to the computer and it charged without problem. So the problem was the cable, not the computer. I'm disappointed as I considered Anker to be a company whose products I could rely on.
