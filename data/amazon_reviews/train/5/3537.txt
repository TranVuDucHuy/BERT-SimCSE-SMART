It’s simple, it works like it is supposed to work. I’ll continue to use SanDisk because I’ve had a long history of good service from their products. The one time a SanDisk card failed, I sent it back to them. They not only recovered all of the images, they also sent a new card. That is customer service and it’s worth a lot.
