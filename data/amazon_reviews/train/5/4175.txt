Purchased this because my son was always complaining about lagging during the most inconvenient times during his games. And frankly I was getting frustrated hearing him complain about it so I picked this cable up and for a short time things was absolutely great! Then the 4 1/2 month old puppy found it so very interesting. Mid game as he chewed it in half and moments later Iâ€™m getting a text message telling me what happened. Of course the pup no longer found it tasty after he competed his objective of make one long cable into two.
