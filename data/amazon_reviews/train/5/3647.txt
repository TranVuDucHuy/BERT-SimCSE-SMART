Great improvement over previous cables to run 4k. Picture quality and sound are spot on. You can't go wrong with the purchase of these 18gbps cables and are far less expensive. Quality and engineering of these cables is superior to most more expensive setups excluding 48gbps cables. Would strongly recommend them to friends and family alike. Extremely pleased with performance.
