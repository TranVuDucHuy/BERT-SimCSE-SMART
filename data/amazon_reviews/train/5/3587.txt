My 32GB SD card ran out of room pretty quick so I grabbed this. This card is faster than my old card and much larger. Moving my data from the old card to the new was easy thanks to the Nintendo guide on their website - just search for "How to Transfer Data Between microSD Cards for Use on Nintendo Switch" and go to the nintendo.com result. You'll also find the link to format the SD card using the official tool from SD alliance. This took a while on my card but it once you do a full format you'll know it's got no bad sectors and the filesystem is right. Simple enough to power off the Switch, remove the SD card, copy over the data by following the article (simple and quick drag and drop if you have two micro SD card adapters for your computer - I had one so copied to my local drive then onto the new SD card). Powered it back on and everything was good, and now I had space to move more games from the console storage to the SD card. You pay a premium for the official branded SD card vs. generic or even name brand but I caught it on sale and it was ok value.
