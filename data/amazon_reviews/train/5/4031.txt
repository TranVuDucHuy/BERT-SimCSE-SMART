I love this little tripod! It is incredibly sturdy and accommodates my S21 Ultra with its clunky OtterBox. I'm not a selfie kinda old lady and doubt I will ever use it for that purpose. I previously purchased a less expensive model that tipped over when my phone (sans OtterBox) was in it. Not this one. Easy to set up, easy to operate, easy to love!
