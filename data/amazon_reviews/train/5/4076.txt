Set this up for my mother. Got it for her for Christmas. She loves it. Such a good gift for a grandparent that lives too far to visit a grand or great grandchild.Picture quality was good. I had no trouble getting it set up, adding pictures and adding “friends” that can add pics to her frame at any time.Totally recommend.
