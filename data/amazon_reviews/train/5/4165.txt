I put this in my DJI Air 2S drone and got a warning that this was a slow card so if you're thinking of buying it for your drone, don't. Buy one that is labeled Extreme or fast or something like that. This can be used elsewhere so I'm not regretting the purchase or anything. Just wanted to put that "warning" out there about it not being a fast enough card for drones.
