I went ahead and splurged on these around 3 to 6 months ago after I stepped on my X3s in the dark and cracked the band mechanism. I do not regret my purchase at all; these cans produce such rich and full-bodied bass-enhanced sound that I can't leave a room in my house without bringing them with me.. in case I need awesome music for a bit.Funny story.. I thought the noise-canceling was just kind of mediocre this whole time, especially when I was flying back from visiting my parents and using them on a plane. The trick is to quickly press the second button toward the back on the left earpiece to activate noise-canceling. It was like the angels sang when I did that.. suddenly the music was so clear and rich, the plane noises virtually eliminated. Duh. So if you own these or are thinking about it, don't forget that tip!As I mentioned, I've owned the older X3 model for quite a few years now and loved them; these X5s are even better and I love them for all music listening occasions. They're a little bassier than the X3s, definitely a step further on that front. I happen to like bass (not muddied, just "full" and well-rounded), and these deliver. The highs and mids never seem to suffer either, though! A lot of it depends on fooling with your app's EQ settings, too. So don't be afraid to experiment!Great headphones and, if you have the money to splurge, they're worth it!♫/♥︎/♫
