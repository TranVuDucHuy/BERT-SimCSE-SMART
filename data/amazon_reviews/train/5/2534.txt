My sister had one in her guest room. It was so handy I bought one for every bedroom at home. Then bought 5 more for all the rooms at our lake house. Then bought another for the room I use at my son’s house. Can’t say enough good about them. Holds all my electronics and I don’t have to crawl under the bed to find an outlet when I need one.
