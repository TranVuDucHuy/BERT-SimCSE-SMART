I was looking for something that didn’t have suction because in the Vegas heat, those with suction cups, just don’t stick! I’ve had it in place 6 weeks so far and it really is great! Phone stays in place, until you move it or release it. Great range of motion to position it how you want and doesn’t move with bumpy roads and such. I’m impressed, especially for the price.
