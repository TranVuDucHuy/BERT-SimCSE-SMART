After I received this little booger I was afraid that every time I unplugged something it would pull out of the wall too. So far, so good. No problems. It seems to hold in pretty sturdy and I'm a little careful when unplugging it, so that helps. A handy little device with lots of versatility. I like the side plugs. No problems so far. If I was buying again, I might find one that screws into the wall faceplate screw hole, just so I never have to worry about it, but I never even considered returning this as it didn't seem to be a real problem and I figured I could use it for travel easier.
