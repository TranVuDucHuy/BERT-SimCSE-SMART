After having my third pair of AirPods up and die on me in four years (Looking at you, Apple!), I decided it was time to try something different. These have been a great replacement and the sound quality is excellent for someone just looking for a decent pair of earbuds.Some drawbacks: The charging case has no lid which makes me anxious carrying around (I bought a silicone case with a lid to go along with it), the fit is a just a little loose compared to AirPods and requires some periodic adjustment, and if you're using Apple devices it requires manual pairing to switch between devices. All and all, these are pretty minor in my opinion and this product offers great value for its quality.The only question left now is longevity, so if I haven't yet come back to add an edit to this then odds are they've managed to last.
