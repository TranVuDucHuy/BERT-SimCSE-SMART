I want to start off by saying I’m not bashing Tile. I bought it because I lose my wallet a lot and so it helps me find it and that works out great. The only thing that annoys me is that when I sit down with my wallet in my back pocket, (which is where I keep it) it sometimes starts making my phone go off due to the tile being “pushed on” and it can go off very publicly.
