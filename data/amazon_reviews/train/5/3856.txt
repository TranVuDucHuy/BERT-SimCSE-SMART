I'm an audiophile of decades experience, with very high quality desktop systems for music only. So why do I like these headphones so much...they stay on when working out, lightweight construction and relatively tight fit does the trick. That fit also gives quite a bit of noise cancelation. I also find them quite comfortable. With good ergonomics, easy BT pairing, a balanced tonal signature with very good resolution, they are easily the best workout headphone (including in-ears) I've used going back about 2 decades. The lightweight construction means they may not last forever, but construction is precise, so with care they should last for a few years anyway. I will also use them for travel and phone/zoom calls. With the very high quality to price ratio it's hard to imagine a better all round headphone.
