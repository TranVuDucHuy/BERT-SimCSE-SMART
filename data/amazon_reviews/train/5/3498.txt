I purchased a set of 4 Arlo Pro Spotlight cameras that included a “trial subscription.”When the trial period ended, my 4 cameraswould trigger, and I was sent a notification, but I was unable to view any of the recordings.I chatted with an Arlo tech support person, and I was told that there is what amounts to a “work around.” I was advised that by purchasing an Arlo base unit, I’d be able to continue to use my cameras similar to the way that they functioned during the trial period.I purchased the VMB5000, synched my four cameras to it- but the cameras did not work.I chatted with a second Arlo tech support person who advised me that I needed a class 10 SD card.I purchased this MICRO card through Amazon, and when it arrived I searched and eventually found the well hidden micro SD card slot. It’s at the bottom of the base unit.The Record locally toggle switch recognized the SD card; and after following the prompts- I successfully formatted the SD card.I activated both the “record locally” toggle switch, as well as, the “direct storage access” toggle.At this point- I was able, while in Wi-Fi mode on my iPhone, to view captured triggered videos from each camera similar to when the trial subscription was active.However, when I was out of Wi-Fi range, once again, I could no longer view any triggered camera videos.Upon further reading, Arlo states that viewing triggered camera videos, remotely, that is, out of Wi-Fi range can be accomplished with by using a VPN, or by using Port Forwarding.I watched a YouTube video, loaded my ISP’s (Spectrum) App onto by iPhone, and with a few inputs*-I’m happy to say that it works.I can, now, view triggered camera videos either locally, or remotely with my iPhonevia the cell phone network.*Arlo app>Devices>Smart Hub/Base Station/Bridge>tap on the base station>Local Storage(storage settings)>activate: Record LocallyDirect Storage Access>tap on: Port Forwarding>activate: Enable Port ForwardingWrite down the internal andexternal port numbers- you willInput these on your ISP’s router.I was fortunate I found a YouTube video with instructions for setting up my ISP, Spectrum, router.Good Luck!(FYI:The VPN setup is believed to be more secure than the port forwarding setup- I may explore the VPN option, there are free VPN apps, and there are subscription VPN apps, as well, but my whole thing was to eliminate yet another monthly subscription.
