I ordered the NC2 at the bugging of October. Great advice noise cancellation and transparency mode for the price point. Anc was great for skateboarding to block out loud metal ramps at the skatepark as well as ppe for when I’m using the grinder for little welding projects at home or mowing the yard/ weed whacking. The transparency mode is great for street skateboarding when I need to be aware of my surroundings. My left ear bud stopped working recently so I contacted the company through their warranty page. They reached out to me very quickly. We went through some trouble shooting but were not able to get it to work again. They just sent me a replacement pair which I’m very grateful for because I use headphones so much. And now that I have gotten accustomed to headphones with anc and a transparency mode it’s hard to go back to my old AirPods. If your on the fence about buying them definitely give them a try. I’ve had a great experience with the product and company 10 out 10.
