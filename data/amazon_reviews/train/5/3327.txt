This works really well. I first had it with the adhesive surface on my dashboard (around the middle of the car). It stuck and worked well, but the apparatus was big enough that I felt it blocked my field of vision (was pretty much right in the visual spot where front-right of car approaches street parked cars. I got rid of the sticky bit and just suctioned to the window near front driver window (near where VIN is). Perfect spot. Doesn't obstruct outside of car, easy to see, I can still snake a charging cord cross top of steering wheel body (unobtrusive, away from legs, not in window). I got one, gave one as gift. Simple and exactly what you need once you figure your best spot.
