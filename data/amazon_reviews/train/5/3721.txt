I was looking for the right SD card for my Nintendo Switch. After doing a thorough research and read their reviews carefully, I am glad I purchase this item online. I heard SanDisk is the best company because their products are very reliable and works very well (most often). I choose “1 TB” because I thought I can downloaded many games in one SD card. Because I don’t want to have too many SD cards for different games. It seems complicated and stress for me. I follow the instructions carefully of how to install in my Nintendo Switch (from one of the video in YouTube). After using this item over a month, I am very happy that I do not have any issues for now. I was able to downloaded over 60 popular games and still have about 700 MBs left. I am very satisfied with my order and I will definitely come back here to shop again!
