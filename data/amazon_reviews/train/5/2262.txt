I bought this phone stand because the reviews were excellent. I agree with all of them! It's very sturdy and I love that I can sit at my desk and my phone is sitting up where I can see it, instead of face down on the desk. Also, I love that I can change the tilt on the stand and it stays put. I think I will be getting a 2nd one very soon.
