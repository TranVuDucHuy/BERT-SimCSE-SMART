I replaced some Haylou earbuds with these cause I wanted to try ANC and Transparency mode. Those were great for being super portable with tiiiiny buds and tiiiiny case, but were faily limited in features. These were pretty much the same price, but are much nicer. The buds themselves are slightly larger, but still comfortable and they have no problem staying in my ears. The mics are much better for calls and in a pinch I've gamed on my PC with them. The auto pause when I remove one is nice, and combined with transparency and ANC make them comparable to muuuuch more expensive buds like the airpod pro's (at least with respect to features I care about. I dont need spatial audio)Transparency is handy, and I use it public spaces like the grocer store or gym when I need to be more aware of my surroundsings. The ANC is fine but nothing to write home about. I more recently the SoundCore Q35's (over the ear headphones) and their ANC is leagues ahead of this. The vacuum, or 3D printer, or electic heater all go to complete silence when I put those on, whereas they just get quiter with these.All the same though, they are super cheap headphones, and reliably pair, they have really good sound and even bass, and have a comparatively tiny case to mose other headphones out there with a similar battery life. I've recommended them to a couple people now and they both also speak highly of them.
