I have tried the suction holders for the windshield and the dash, the pop socket holders, other vent holders, magnetsâ€¦ this one by far takes the cake, itâ€™s easy to install, it has a pretty strong hold, fits most vehicle vent types, it is adjustable so you can rotate it, it has only fallen off twice because I didnâ€™t have it tight enough one time ðŸ˜† and the other time I literally pulled my phone off in a hurry without releasing it, and it came off. (It has a tight hold on your phone which in my opinion is good) Iâ€™ve had it for half of a year now and itâ€™s still going strong, the only thing I am opposed to not just for this brand but for all vent phone holders, if you arenâ€™t able to shut the vent air off on that vent it can cause your phone to overheat. Other than that 5/5!
