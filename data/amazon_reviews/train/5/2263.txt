It was a little harder to move than I expected which is probably good. Don't be afraid you'll break it, just give it a little force. It's really pretty. Area in the back for a cord makes it easy to charge. Bottom seems sufficiently grippy. I have a pop socket and it works fine whether it's on or off.
