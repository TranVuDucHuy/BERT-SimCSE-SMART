I got these on sale so they were a steal! Literally the battery life is soo good i only have to charge them once every 3 weeks or so and I use them regularly. They are not noise canceling, but i kind of prefer that. I have a tiny child size head so maybe that's part of it but I still think they fit well and I can do a lot without them falling off. I even did yoga with them on once. Wear them on my walks, before bed, and on long plane rides. This was My introduction into over the ear headphones and it's a 10/10 for me!
