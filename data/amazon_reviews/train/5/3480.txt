I live in an apartment building with thin floors and noisy upstairs neighbors, and a construction side right across the street, and I’m very sensitive to loud, constant noise. I’ve tried several noise cancelling headphones and none fit my head better. They were either too heavy, not tight enough to create a good seal around my ears, or simply uncomfortable. These headphones are fantastic. They fit my small head perfectly, I can wear them for hours and the sound is phenomenal. I wouldn’t say they cancel noise completely if there’s any noise close by (e.g. my own tv is on), but whatever noise does come through is greatly reduced (the noise cancelling works a lot better if I’m listening to music instead of audiobooks). As far as construction noises and stomping on the ceiling goes, they are completely canceled. I love these headphones! They are saving my sanity everyday, which makes the price tag so worth it for me.
