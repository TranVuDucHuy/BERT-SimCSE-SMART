Was tired of getting my plug in earphones out, untangling the cords and limited to any movement away from the laptop such as reaching forward to pick up a glass from my coffee table.These are so comfortable I forget I'm using them unless I go out of range and get a pleasant tone to let me know.I've seen my nearly adult age grandkids using them and thought, These kids are more comfortable than I am!
