I love this stylus! It looks just like an Apple Pencil but is even easier to charge and less than half the price. I’ve been using it for about a week on my 2018 iPad and it works amazing. I use to take notes mainly but it also works to just navigate around the iPad. Super easy to connect and it automatically connects every time. Sometimes it does turn off but all you have to do it tap the top it’s very easy. I bought a case for the iPad that has a holder and it fits great. Only wish is that it showed battery percentage somewhere. I’ve charged it a few times and it’s never died but I don’t known how long the charge lasts for. Not a big problem though. Highly recommend as an amazing Apple Pencil dupe.
