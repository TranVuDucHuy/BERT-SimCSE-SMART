I loved how easy it was to run under carpet and under base boards!! I was even able to run it under a metal transition between carpet and tile floor!! While 100ft turned out to be too long for my application I was able to roll the excess up and hide it behind my small entertainment center. We have used this continuously since I received it almost 3 months ago and the speed allows you to use this for anything from Teleworking to Gaming. My wife worked from home and needed a more stable connection so installing this cable gave us that. We had been using a plugged in wireless ethernet modem.
