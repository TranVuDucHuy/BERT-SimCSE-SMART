I’m not a sound guy, so if you’re looking for a professional opinion on bass, treble and all of that, I can’t help you. What I can say is that these sound extremely good.These are the first pair of earbuds that I forget are in my ear, super comfy and fit perfectly straight out of the box. I’ve owned Beats version of EarPods and they would be uncomfortable after just a few hours.And lastly the battery life is good, it’s sufficient for me. I usually keep one in at a time, and on occasion I’ll use both when I’m out walking. And they immediately go back in the case when I’m done. And when I get home they go on the charger whether it’s fully charged or not.You just can’t go wrong with these.
