I have had these for over 6 months, and I have others that I paid high price for that have gone out the door as gifts to family because they hurt my ears after using a few hours. I bought a cheep pair from another company and Loved them but after a year, they didn't charge anymore which was fine because I didn't pay much for them. This time I decided to buy them from Amazon because if there is ever a problem, I know I'll get it refunded quickly and although these looked like the pair I had they weren't exactly the same.I love these they keep power during the entire day and some, I wear them all day to answer calls on my phone, listen to music, etc. If someone comes up to me to speak to me I have to take one of them out because it cancels the noise completely.I decided today that I wanted another pair to have with me when I'm away from my desk so I bought another pair. I may buy another just to have an array of colors. I hope they continue to offer this product, because it is better than what I paid for name brand wireless buds.
