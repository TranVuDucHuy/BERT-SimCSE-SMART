It definitely holds up your phone!Now, it's pretty useful. I'm an artist for a living and I use it all the time, maybe 24/7, to hold my phone up so I can either keep track of notifications or use it for references. And it works! I always use the bottom of it to store some random small items like hair ties. The wideness of it helps keep it upright so it doesn't fall over even slightly easily as long as you don't basically punch it.There is a capability of pulling it out so it's higher, but that function is kinda useless? It'd be nice if it could extend a little more or something, but it'd be useful for others, just not me.Overall, a *very* sturdy product. It may look a bit boring compared to some other phone stands, but it absolutely gets the job done. Not to mention that it has an opening at the bottom of the phone holder for a charger!!! Now THAT'S a huge benefit that is worthy of 5 stars alone. Good recommendation!
