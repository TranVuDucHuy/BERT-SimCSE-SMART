This stand is stable and at a perfect height for video calls. I appreciate the design that lets the charger cord feed through the back (so I can find it!) and loop around without kinking it. I previously had a phone holder that clamped onto the desk. It was hard to adjust and kept getting loose. I'm happy that it finally broke so I went on the hunt and found this LISEN Cell Phone Stand.
