The best thing about these earbuds is the sound quality. They’re Bose. Of course the sound is superb. And you can customize it if that’s your thing. More bass? Less? No problem.The second best thing about this set is the noise canceling feature. It completely wipes out the noise around you. Great if you’re in a plane or at the gym, or in the room with your hubby who’s watching something obnoxious on the TV and you’d rather listen to your book or podcast. Not so great if you’re out jogging. You need your ears on alert in that situation. Please ladies!! Don’t run alone and don’t run with noise cancellation mode on!! If you still want your music and awareness on, you can do that with a tap. There is a way to adjust the settings so that the “aware” feature does not amplify outside sounds.Third best feature is the easy control while buds are in place. Taps and swipes do it all: volume, fast forward, rewind, stop, start, aware on/off.The final feature that I like is the app you have to download. Use the app to set up your buds and to customize the features. I am 67 years old and was able to do all the setup quite easily—without the help of my grandchildren, lol!Bonus: the battery lasts a long, long time!!The ONLY thing I don’t like about these earbuds is that they are not comfortable for sleeping in. I like to fall asleep to a book or podcast on a timer. For that I go back to my airpods, as they easily sit on my ears without pain through the night if needed.I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the lightness of these buds and the ease of operation. They come with 3 different sized sets of ear pieces for a perfect custom fit. You may have to take some time to figure out which combo works best for you.
