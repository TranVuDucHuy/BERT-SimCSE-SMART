ordered the extreme 128 cards and ultra 512 cards in Dec 2022 they were $14.99 for the 128gb and 39.99 for the 512gbGot the ultra 512 for Nintendo Switch (no formatting needed, also no point in paying extra for the extreme cards for switch cuz switch has limited write speed) and the extreme 128s for Wyze cameras (also no formatting needed)This sale pricing started around black Friday and went thru most of December
