I just got a brand new Ipad for Christmas. I was hesitant to buy this instead of the Apple Pen itself. But I just couldn't wrap my mind around the price tag of the apple pen. I decided to give this a try and I am so glad I did! I haven't had any problems with it at all! It stays charged for hours and does everything I need it to do at a fraction of the price. So glad I purchased this!
