I did a lot of research before deciding to finally go with the QC45. Working from home in a busy environment and traveling a bunch... I wear headphones all day. My main criterium were comfort and ANC. These headphones are absolutely perfect for both of that. I have no complaints about the sound quality either, it actually sounds pretty good after playing a bit with the EQ without really knowing what I was doing until it sounded good to me. I wore them for 10hrs straight on my first day and it didn't bother me at all, they are really light. Absolutely no regrets getting these over the xm4 imo... worth the money if you weear them a a lot.
