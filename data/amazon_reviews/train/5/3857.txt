My youngest has tried different ear pieces and such. Nothing ever worked and nothing fit in her ears. Sheâ€™s a preteen but has tiny ears so hard to find something that fits. She asked for some Bluetooth headphones for Christmas and I got these on sale. They are perfect and fit her perfectly. She uses them all the time and I no longer have to hear her siblings complain about her volume in her phone. Charges easily, holds a charge for days, sound is amazing. JBL made some amazing headphones.
