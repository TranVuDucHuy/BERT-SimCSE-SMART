Update: It turns out that my old Dell doesn’t output audio through the display port, oh well. This cable still works fantastically for video.Original: I bought this for a 2010 Dell 780 USFF that I’ve had for years, but lost my old VGA to HDMI adapter cable for. I had bought another, but it didn’t work at all…So I decided I’d try to go the easy route and use the display port, since it carry’s both audio and video. This happened to be the least expensive and fastest shipping option so I went with it and I’m glad I did. It works beautifully so far.So far I haven’t tested the audio yet, because I had to reinstall windows 10 on the HDD I swapped into it somewhere along the way. It’s still installing as I write this, which is why I took the time to write this. These old core 2 duos aren’t exactly known for being fast processors.As always, amazon basics shocks me with another decent product. I’ll update this review once I get a chance to check the audio output.
