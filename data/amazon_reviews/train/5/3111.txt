I have purchased a number of this over the years and they have always worked great. I will be installing one of the two cartridges today. I am on my second drum unit and i have gone through a number of toner cartridges as well, alway buying Brothers products. I am amazed at the life I am getting out of this printer. As long as it keeps working, I will continue buying these toner cartridges.
