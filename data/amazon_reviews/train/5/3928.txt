These headphones check every box for features that I needed and then some. The cord length is incredible - not so long that it'll get twisted up around my chair wheels, but not so short that I'll destroy them pulling them out of my computer jack.The sound quality is truly very, very good. My Sony Bluetooth headphones have *slightly* better overall sound quality, but these have a smidge higher maximum decibel level. The bass response is respectable, though not quite as deep as I was expecting - though do not misunderstand me, the bass IS just fine, *especially* for watching movies/shows on my computer.In particular, I am really looking forward to trying out the "sharing" function in a couple weeks: we're going on a family vacation, but me and the wife invariably stay up later than our young children. With these headphones, we can watch something together on my laptop after the kids go to bed, by plugging the Sony headphones in to these. This is a great feature, and not even one that I was looking for!These headphones are far superior than anything else in this price range. If you don't have a $200+ budget, GET THESE! Overall, I just really highly recommend this product.*I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW IN EVENT THAT I HAVE ANY QUALITY ISSUES LATER. IF THIS REVIEW IS NEVER UPDATED, THEN I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE PRODUCT AFTER THE INITIAL REVIEW.*
