I've always used genuine Brother consumables but last time only a knockoff was available. Even though it was called high yield, it only lasted as long as a standard toner. The phony one also clicked every time I printed. Take a look at the construction difference, the Brother cartridge is rock solid and the 660 has always lasted much longer. So, in the end, you save buying the real deal.
