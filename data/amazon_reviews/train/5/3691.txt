The most important for Flash memory / SD-Cards are the technical characteristics. Nextbase wants V30, U3. That SanDisk (Western Digital!) SD-card works perfectly and costs less than the "Nextbase" branded ones with the same characteristics. Only thing you have to do: You should format them in the main menu of the dashcam.I'm satisfied. Works flawlessly. No missing frames in 4K/30.
