I was pleased at how (relatively) easily it went together. The parts are well made, and all of the fasteners are in separate pouches of a long string of bags, designated by whichever step in the process you are in. I was especially happy that the screws for he back of the TV were in the kit, or I would have had to halt the process, and buy some...most new TVs come with them, but mine was used. You'll only need about 1/3rd of screws and hardware enclosed, which helps to make it fit such a vast array of TVs.I was also happy to see that the parts that attach to the wall are separate in the process from the TV. Where the two sections come together is well thought out.It took me about 1.5 hours to attach the part that goes on the wall, to the wall; and the parts that attach to the TV to the TV.You'll need the tools that are recommended, especially the drill that you'll be making the pilot holes in the wall with. I recommend a cordless impact driver and a 7/16" impact socket to fasten the bracket to the wall. I think the instructions call for a socket wrench. I also recommend (depending on the size of the TV) an assistant for the final step: attaching the TV hardware to the wall bracket
