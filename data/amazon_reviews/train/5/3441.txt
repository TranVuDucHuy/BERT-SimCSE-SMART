I use these for connecting various USB peripherals to a MacBook Pro. Everything works well, the only drawback is the width prevents using two adapters side-by-side at the same time, but this would be an issue with any adapter of this type. You can buy other adapters that include a short cable with a smaller USC-c plus if that's an issue for you. I chose to eliminate another cable and use these instead, very convenient.
