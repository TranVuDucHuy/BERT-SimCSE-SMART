I ordered the Owl 3 for personal and professional use. I’m admittedly a bit of a technophile, but I found the set up to be intuitive. I work in academia, and in anticipation of the upcoming semester, I did a few test runs to connect with students and colleagues remotely. The quality of the audio and camera was impressive to me, a significant upgrade from my current set up. The 360 camera, especially, is going to be useful in the classroom context, so I’m excited to use it a bit more this year. From these initial impressions, my sense is that the Owl and tools like it can help alleviate some of the awkwardness I’ve experienced with hybrid pedagogy and collaboration, with some folks in the room and other joining from elsewhere.
