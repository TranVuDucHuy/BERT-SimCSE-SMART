Nice to be able to have phone, watch and airpods charging at same time and not having all the cords laying around but it doesn't seem to be fast charging when charging more than one thing. You can turn the blue light off which is nice. I am however having an issue with the light flashing and my airpods are not fully charging. They never really seem to fully charge but if I plug cord directly into the case they do so I've been charging that way which is defeating the purpose of why I ordered this. You can turn the phone either vertical or horizontal and the stand folds flat which is great for traveling. Overall great product with the exception of the airpod charging. Should take off 1 star but maybe just a defective device. Overall great all in one charging station
