OK, so I haven't owned it long, but after reading other comments I think spending a few more dollars on this should be worth it as it seemed other ones broke right away. We've just tried this in our home, but it should be lots of fun to take on vacation to Florida. As with any product, it will probably blow over in the wind, but if you want a selfie stick this one should be great for an amateur and not too hard to use. Be mindful that the seven segments do take a little muscle to pull out at first but should loosen up with use. (I'm a 5-foot Senior lady and it took me a bit, but I did it.) Be sure if you take it to the beach you don't put it away with sand stuck to it but wait for it to thoroughly dry. The TSA regulations said OK to bring in carryon too.
