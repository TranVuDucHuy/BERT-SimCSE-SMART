Maybe read the instructions before setting up, this isn’t like the other mounts with this one you have to tighten it to your cars air vent and can be a pain if you have to take it off and on like switching cars so keep that in mind but it’s a good useful product to have especially if your job requires you to drive to different places and you have to use your GPS a lot. It works so well that sometimes I forget to click the button on the back that ejects your phone and I’ll leave my phone in the car. 10/10 would recommend
