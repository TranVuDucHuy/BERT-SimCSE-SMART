Of course there are a ton of DAPs and DAC/Amps that have better sound quality and higher power output, but as long as you don't need to drive full size headphones and play files over 24bit/48khz, you're only going to get marginal benefits with a dedicated DAP or DAC with sensitive IEMs/earphones, and nothing beats the Apple adapter for simple plug and play on iPhones. The Adapter images solidly on a spacious yet focused stage, with excellent microdynamics and detail retrieval that convincingly conveys space with clearly defined echos and reverb, and the tonality is pretty natural and neutral with good realism and texture, with the only negative being slight grittiness with extreme transients in the upper mid to higher frequencies; not top performing sound, but for $7-9, size, and ease of use? It can't be beat. With care, they can last a while, but even if I was rough with them and had to buy 4-5 a year, they're cheap and sound good enough to replace and buy multiples of anyway. Sometimes I will listen to my Sony ZX2 for a slightly better, more natural sound, but because the Apple adapter is much smaller and easier to use, and I don't perceive a huge loss of sonic performance, I find I listen more with my iPhone and Apple music, still extremely enjoyable with ultra-efficient and high performing IEMs. Again, if you have full size headphones or inefficient IEMs, you will probably need an better powered DAC/amp for them to sound their best, but if you're using <16ohm IEMs, it sounds just fine for casual but engaging listening and I'm hard pressed to justify something 10-20 times more the price for maybe 5% better sound.
