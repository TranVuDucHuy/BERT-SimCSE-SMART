We bought a new 65 inch LED screen that was larger and heavier than the old one, and this was my first time trying a wall-mount. This unit was probably overkill as it is rated for 132 lbs while my TV is only 50 lbs. It came with all the parts I needed to install into the wall, including a small bubble-level! I had to use my drill and bits to set up for the bolts, but once that was done the backplate mounted easily. Once the back-plate is into the wall with 4 long lag bolts, and the front bracket installed on the back of the TV, the two mate by simple hanging the front onto the back and tightening some lock screws so it can't come free. Very flexible once installed, allows us to pull screen out and change angles easily. Highly recommend.
