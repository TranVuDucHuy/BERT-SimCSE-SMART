Honestly when I realized I could play xbox game pass games without owning an xbox, just running it on my phone with this thing, an entire world opened up. I have a Playstation, Switch, and PC. I can now play my steam library via Steam Link on my phone, or Playstation games via Remote Play on my phone, or any xbox game that's included with game pass (which it looks like is a TON of them, even heavy graphics games).Basically all the games you wish were Switch games can now feel like Switch games. I love this thing. Best purchase I've made in a while.I do advise that whatever you are streaming to your phone be hard wired to the internet - for example if you're doing Playstation Remote Play make sure your Playstation is hard wired, it will run better. Same with your PC for Steam Link.HIGHLY recommend this product! I got the white playstation edition and the buttons feel so smooth and the whole thing is well made and sturdy/high quality.
