No complaints on this one! Great alternative to the more expensive apple AirPods. They are small and sleek and fit just right. They are comfortable on the ears and stay in place even when running or working out. The case it comes in is perfect size to throw into a gym bag or purse and take them with you. The battery life lasts awhile. I feel like I barely ever charge them. Perfect option if your looking for something completely wireless. The sound quality is great and does a good job at cancelling out outside noise without having to turn the volume up on these too high. The sound remains good while others around you cannot hear what you are listening to. I would highly recommend investing in a pair!!
