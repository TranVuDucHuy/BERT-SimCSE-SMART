Bought a few of these for my room years ago, recommended them to my girlfriend too. Now we live together and all four that we bought years ago are in use around our house.Value: Paid $19.58 back then, which felt pricey but fair.Functionality: These work well and and are very consistent.Key Features: The little sliders that cover the outlet openings when not in use are awesome. The outlet arrangement is very accommodating to whatever cord adjustments you might need to make.Cons: Sometimes those little outlet sliders get stuck, and sometimes they break. It is what it is, still love these.
