I’ve used this product nonstop for a week, and here are the notes worth sharing that I have on them:- The bass boost mode is surprisingly good for its price, and doesn’t lessen or muffle the rest of the music, but is a bit less than I would personally like (though I am a bit of a basshead with my music)- The noise cancelling isn’t super efficient, and only slightly gets rid of background noise, but also makes audio that you’re listening to quieter as well. It also doesn’t work from any sound coming from near the part between where the headphones meet your ears, (for example I have a very vocal pet bird that tends to lean on my neck, and the headphones aren’t great to quiet the noise,) but I suppose that makes sense- The padding of the headphones is good for the price, but tends to let sound leak out and share your music with the people around you, mostly if it’s with a heavy bass or has a higher volume than 50%- Absolutely phenomenal battery life!! I haven’t timed it before and compared it to how much it advertises, but it’s very good, and can last a long time depending on whether noise cancelling or the bass boost is on- If you apply too much pressure to one of the headphone ears (I’m not sure what else to call it, earpads? noisemakers?) it causes the audio to start rapidly switching between the actual audio and a loud bass white noise, which I could only compare to the feeling of building air pressure making your eardrums start to do the same thing- The charging port/place to plug in the charger into the headphones is surprisingly difficult to plug in, but luckily only has to be done every couple days with its battery lifeOverall it’s a wonderful pair of wireless headphones, and even though it comes with it’s own small inconveniences or conditions, they are great quality and a product I highly recommend.
