Nice Mount, I bought two mounts. One for a 44" and the other for a 65" TV. I didn't realize I bought them from two different vendors. Here is the kick, all the hardware, instruction pretty much identical.So this is for the 44" TV. Easy guide to follow and it is a solid mount. I followed the instruction although very brief it was easy to assemble and hand. I would recommend this one also
