If you've ever wanted to use a standard keyboard and/or a mouse on your tablet, this little adapter gadget is just the thing! As you can see, it comes with two kinds..one for what I think are called "C" cables and the other kind -- I'm not well versed! Anyway it plugs into your device and then you're able to use a USB connected gadget such as your mouse or keyboard and it just makes using your tablet or anything that you want to add a peripheral like that to sooo much more fun and oh so much easier! I'm thrilled!!! I didn't even know they made these and they come in different colors too. Delivery fast and packaging great!
