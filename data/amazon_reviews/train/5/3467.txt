This is the best pair of headphones I have ever had!! The noise canceling works great. I've used this brand's ear buds before, and I love those, but headphones work so much better for me because I often times find my earbuds falling out. Anyway, I've worn these for maybe 5ish minutes now, and I will say that the comfort level on these is something I will have to get used to. If you have a sensitivity to head pressure, these hug your head a bit tight, so do pay attention to that. It's like putting on a pair of sunglasses (or glasses in general) that just barely fit your face--it's a little tight but not unmanageable. After a few hours that may change. Also, these have the ability to extend, which is really nice as it ensures a good fit for everyone.Another thing: they come partially charged! According to my phone roughly 80% charged. Set up is ridiculously easy. Press and hold the power button and it will turn on and automatically start trying to pair with a device. There is also the ability to turn the noise cancelling (NC button) function off and back on. It defaults to being on, but if you want to listen to music and still hear your surroundings, this is great for you too. The inside of the ear muffs come labeled L and R, which is helpful, as music quality changes if you listen to it on the wrong side (ex. Charlie Puth's "Left and Right" has music individually sounded through the left side then right, and if you were to wear the headphones backwards then the directions would not line up, lol).These headphones come with a charger, an auxiliary cord to plug in to the headphones and a phone in case you don't want to use bluetooth. There is also a cute little bag that comes with for you to put the headphones in when you aren't using them. Instructions are also included. If you made it all the way down to the bottom of this review, thanks so much for reading my little infomercial, LOL. Have a great day!Rating: 9/10 (one point deduction for head-tightness.)
