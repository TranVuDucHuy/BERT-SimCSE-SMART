I purchased this to run through my attic to support a PoE camera with PTZ. I've had concerns in the past about flat Ethernet cables but this one doesn't have any issue. Granted, the camera only uses a 100Mbps connection but this cable supports it fine along with 30W of power to operate it.Update: Now using both the original 50ft and a new 25ft cable for separate cameras. Both are working great.
