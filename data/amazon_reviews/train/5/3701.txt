I bought this to replace the USB-C to HDMI/VGA adapter that I bought with my Dell XPS several years prior, which I had been using to output video from my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 to a portable projector. The adapter from Dell was starting to fail, and seemed to pick and choose when it was going to output video from my phone via HDMI. I decided to take a gamble on this item since it was 1/3 the price of the Dell adapter and I didn't need VGA output capability.I'm glad I did. It was much less expensive, much more compact, and does exactly what I expect it to do. For $17, this is a no-brainer.
