This review is for SanDisk 256GB High Endurance Video microSDXC Card with Adapter for Dash Cam and Home Monitoring systems - C10, U3, V30, 4K UHD, Micro SD Card - SDSQQNR-256G-GN6IA. I bought three of these back in August during the heat of the summer for my TP-Link cameras and dashcam. It is now freezing winter and they have been performing perfectly without any glitches or errors. I waited to review them because I wasn’t sure how well they would hold up in our Chicagoland winter but so far, I’ve seen no issues. One was in my dashcam all summer roasting and now all are in below freezing temperatures, and all is well. My cameras are all protected from rain so I cannot speak to that but in terms of heat, humidity and temperature, these are the ones you want. I have learned to not buy regular microSD cards meant for light photography and mobile phones because they just can’t take the constant write, overwrite, and retrieval that is needed in dashcams and home monitoring systems. Plus, they have to be able to withstand harsh elements from the burning sun to high humidity to freezing cold. I was worried that these cards might be compromised because they are made in China but they turned out to be fine. Each comes with an adapter, which is nice, but now I have three lying around. Overall, an excellent high endurance card. I would definitely recommend it and I have done so many times. I would give it 5.0/5.0 –12/19/2022.
