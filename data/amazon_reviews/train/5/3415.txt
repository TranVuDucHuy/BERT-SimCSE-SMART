This unit was purchased on 02/02/23, following a prior purchase on 01/11/23 of a similar Addtam extender which included a very useful night light. This wall charger/outlet extender was selected for use in a master bedroom. A bed sits slightly in front of the device so it is not easily visible which my wife really likes. Howver, it is easily accessible and is currently used to power/charge a bedside table lamp, clock radio, Apple watch, and an iPhone. Several outlets remain to power other devices, such as an iPad, etc., if desired.This wall charger maximizes functionality and minimizes space previously required to charge various Apple products plugged into several outlets in the room.If interested, see my review of the Addtam surge protector/outlet extender with night light that has been installed in our kitchen.
