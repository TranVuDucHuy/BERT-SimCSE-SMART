EDIT: the customer service team was actually really helpful and they resolved my problem so I’m bumping up the rating.I got the black Pros. Had these for about 7 months and recently the left ear bud stopped working. It stopped emitting sound.Battery life is great. They are also pretty light weight and stay in your ear well enough. They still fall out occasionally but much less than my AirPods did. I like that they’re pretty cheap but I still wish they lasted a bit longer. I didn’t expect to need a replacement so soon.Another con is that there doesn’t seem to be any carrying case for the Pros so the only option is to throw them in whatever bag I happen to be carrying. Makes it inconvenient to access because I always need to rummage in my bag to use them or put them away. I’m also usually on the move during this process so I don’t always have both hands free to easily do this.Another major con is the lack of easy switching between different devices. If they are connected to one of my devices and next time I go to use it in a different device, I have to take out the last device and disconnect the ear pods before I can connect them to the device I now want to use. Since the pods automatically connect to the last device they were conncected to, this is a HUGE pain if you regularly switch between two or three devices (phone, laptop, etc). But I know other devices also struggle with switching between devices so I guess I can only complain about that so much.
