I actually didn't buy this because I wanted to cover my camera. I bought it because I bought a case for my cell phone that has a built in screen protector, the issue is that if moisture, condensation, sweat, anything gets under the screen protector, through the camera hole, the whole set up is shot. Unfortunately, it's not possible to remove, wipe dry or let dry, and then put it back on.I use this to protect the camera hole from moisture, and it's worked perfectly since I've installed it. It hasn't fallen off or even become loose, the adhesion is perfect.
