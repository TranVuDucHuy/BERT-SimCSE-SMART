This cable is nice and thick. Well made and durable. I had an older thinner 25 foot cable that was having connection issues recently. The cable wasn't damaged but it was still having connection issues between my PC and TV. I'd turn it off of PC then back to PC and the TV wouldn't find the signal. So I bought this cable and that has never happened again. A great thick cable for long distances. I highly recommend it however it is thick so keep in mind that it is harder to hide.
