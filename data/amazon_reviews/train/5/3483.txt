They are also very well built and have a nicely balanced sound signature. These headphones do a great job of separating/layering different instruments and elements of sound which I appreciate. I have had a couple issues with connection and during calls where it sound choppy or static-y but flicking the power switch off and on solves it. My biggest complaint would probably just be that it’s lacking in the bass department but I also bought the Skullcandy Crusher Evos for a fun, bass heavy listening experience. Overall the QC45s are great for all cases as an everyday set of headphones. I was debating getting the AirPod Maxes but I’d much rather own both the Bose/SkullCandy headphones at a lesser combined price than 1 pair of AirPod Maxes.
