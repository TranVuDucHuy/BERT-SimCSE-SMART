I bought one of these for my mother-in-law. She had one of the old ones that have a bunch of old photos. This one is good because anyone can add photos to this frame at any time. I loaded it with a ton of photos and had no problem. It connected to my wifi with no issues. You do need to download an app, which is fine. Once you do that it's dead easy to add photos, particularly from an iphone. Other frames allow you to add photos with just an email. I would love that, but that is not an option here. Too bad. I liked it so much, I bought another one for my step-mother. No issues with that one either.
