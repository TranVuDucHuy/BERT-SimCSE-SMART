Many products have skimpy, poorly written instructions and all the nuts and bolts thrown into one bag. I’ve spend too long in the past trying to figure out which blot to use.This wall mount comes with very clear instructions and all the bolts etc are separated and labeled, making it very easy to install.It easily supports our 60 inch TV. It it a little stiff when moving the TV but it’d rather have that if it means a sturdy support system.
