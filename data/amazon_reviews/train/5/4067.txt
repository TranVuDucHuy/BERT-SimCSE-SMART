I bought this Ethernet cable to work from home. I used to have the regular Ethernet cable that came with my internet service/modem and my internet kept dropping while I was working. During a meeting I was told the best Ethernet cables were cat8. I ordered a short one since my modem is right behind my computer but so far so good
