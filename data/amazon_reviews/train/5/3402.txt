I've millions of bluetooth/headphones that i use for a loud work environment so volume and ANC is a big deal. the only drawback with ANC is that drains the battery and no one pair can get me thru the day. So currently i also use the Jabra Elite Pro 7 and I just get these Beats Studio Buds. The Beats replaced JAbra Elite 75t AND my AirPods Pro Max. The Jabra 75t are just old and don't work as well and the AirPods which have great sound and call just don't stay in my ears so I actually had to buy the plastic covers that go on the AirPods so they lock in better. For the price they should just stay in. Also the AirPods battery is done to about 4 hours! The Beats Studio Buds are small, even though the case is huge! The price isn't bad at $150, the Jabra Pro 7 was $130. I've gotten almost 6 hours out of the battery but it is brand new. The sound quality is really good, I played Whole Lotta Love by Zeppelin and it sounded great. The ANC is great too, blocks out outside noise great. I have smaller ears so the fit is good for me and I like the minimalist style of these. Bose and AirPods are over $200 so like i said these are $150 and are really a bargain in my opinion!
