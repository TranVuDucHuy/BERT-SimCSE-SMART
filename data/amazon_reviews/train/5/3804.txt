Received this product in October. Wanted to wait awhile before reviewing. I work from home and have it on my desk. I love not having to use plugs/wires to charge. My phone and watch stay fully charged and I like have a dedicated spot for both. It’s easy and simple to use. Plug it in and it’s ready to start charging. Definitely recommend!!!
