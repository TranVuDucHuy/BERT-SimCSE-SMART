I bought this charger because I wanted something to charge my apple watch and my phone at the same time. I did not like the clutter of having 2 cords in the outlet. This is a total game changer. I was worried that I was going to have to take my case off in order for it to charge, but I did not have to! My phone charges on the port as well as the apple watch. This is a great investment and would recommend to others!
