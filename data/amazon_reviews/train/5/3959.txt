I’ve been putting off installing this for awhile because I couldn’t make a decision if I wanted to use the tape or screws. I read that a lot of people said the tape was too much and it ripped off the drywall when trying to remove it. I don’t envision removing it but to prevent that from happening, I only put 2-3 inch long strips x 3 alongside the back so it’s not completely stuck behind. I forgot to take a before picture but I’m very happy I finally figured out a solution to my dangling cord. It always gets in the way of vacuuming but that won’t happen anymore!
