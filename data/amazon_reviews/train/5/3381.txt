I was slightly hesitant to get this as I look over the good and the bad when it comes to reviews. Y'all at this point I'm starting to believe that people who have such trouble are the problem. Granted the instructions are a bit overcomplicated, but in general when in doubt just follow the picture. Also a socket wrench was my best friend and made life a heck of a lot easier. Also those who say the TV fell..... Was it truly in a stud... Because there's no way it would have come off the wall if it was. I was nervous only because I was by myself and I realized four hands might be beneficial when tightening the bracket for the TV position.... It was surprisingly easy as well.... So if you're a single organism, don't worry it should work just fine as long as you screw the mount into the stud or brick wall properly. (That means you will need a drill, so if you don't have one get one)
