It works as advertised. The only problem we had was not the fault of the Owl. We were having difficulty hearing some people seated around a big table. The problem turned out to be that those people had a laptop computer in front of them. The laptop was blocking their speech. Their voices sounded garbled. We moved the laptops. Problem solved.
