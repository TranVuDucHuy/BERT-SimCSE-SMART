First of all this is a great price for the quality product you receive. I left the manual at home but I just looked on amazon on the product and there's a video that walks you through. It was so easy to install and can't believe how sturdy it is. The adjustment is so high tech too and user friendly. I love it! Even the place for the charger isn't in the way. You can also turn it to have your phone sideways!Highly highly recommend, don't look any further if you are deciding on a car phone holder to purchase. I promise you will love it!
