I have been struggling to find earbuds that don’t hurt my ears. None of the Apple ones work for me, nor do various Galaxy buds and I think I’ve tried about everything in between, high priced and low, in desperation to find some what work for me.I don’t think I have especially small ears, pretty normal, but for whatever reason ear buds tend to make my ears throb and my head hurt after only minutes in my ear. It has nothing to do with volume, just how sensitive my ears are, I suppose.These Bose Sport Earbuds I wear and literally forget they are in my ears. I consider this a minor miracle, and I know that sounds silly, but I am so happy I found them.I was very skeptical due to the little wing that sits in the outer ear, but I can’t feel it or the earbuds at all.AND the sound is great. I listen to a wide variety of types of music as well as audio books, and I’ve been very impressed with the sound.If I had to say something negative it would be that occasionally if I try to wear only one of the earbuds the Bluetooth doesn’t play nicely. It sometimes disconnects and takes a few tries to get going. Once good, it lasts though.And this has never happened with I use both earbuds, so I’m fine working around it.The case is a bit large, but that’s not a deal breaker for me, either.
