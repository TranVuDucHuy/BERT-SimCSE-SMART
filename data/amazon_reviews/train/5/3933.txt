For it's size, it seems to be really great. I filled this USB chip up with videos a couple months ago and have been repeat-testing it ever since....no certifiable errors ever showed up throughout that testing -- if there were some, I didn't see them, so I'll have to give this little guy an A+ for dependablity....and once I even had it accidently a little close to a magnetic tray, but not any errors resulted from that.Half a TeraByte, and fast as is it is apparently also very reliable. I shall continue testing, but I think it's a great purchase. I'm a diligent tester by nature, and I'm becoming a real believer in this thing.Soon, I would expect a whole TeraByte USB to come out most likely. I figured this 1/2 Tb unit's capacity to be more than 183 hours of video. Wow.
