I almost went for something cheaper but I'm glad I chose MAYBESTA. I plugged the receiver into my iPhone 13 Pro and it instantly connected with no issues.Tested the sound quality in Tiktok app and the quality rivals the built-in phone microphone which was already pretty good. I also went into another room and it was still recording audio just fine.I'm pretty happy with my purchase and I think you will too. =)
