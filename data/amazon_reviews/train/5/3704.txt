Anker is my go-to for chargers, cables, adapters, power strips and docks. I can’t say enough wonderful things about their stuff and on the rare occasion that one of their products does not perform to expectations the they will make it right. Don’t bother buying any other brand. :) And, no, I’m not on their payroll nor did I receive any sort of compensation for this review. Anker is simply excellent.
