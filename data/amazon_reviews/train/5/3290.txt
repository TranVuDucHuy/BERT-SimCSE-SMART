I just connect my monitor to my laptop with this cord and I had no issues. The cord is very thick, covered in a some type of material and looks very sturdy and durable. If you unplug your laptop from your monitor often, I highly recommend you purchase this cord. As a college student this was very affordable. I am very happy with this purchase.
