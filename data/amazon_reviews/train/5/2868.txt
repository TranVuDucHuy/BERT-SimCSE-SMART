I was looking for a headphone that was affordable and di the job. This was it. the color is nice. I got the black one. The instructions are easy to follow and set up. I don't use the tap features that much since I use either my watch or phone to turn the volume up/down and/or change the music. The battery last a long time. I don't use it for long periods of time. My typical day use is between 1-2 hours a day and it last up to a week for me. I would get it again.
