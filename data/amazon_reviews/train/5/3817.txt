This holder is the one you've been looking for; they finally got it right. There are three parts. THe rear is a padded clamp that secures onto an outer fin of your A/C vent. A small thumb screw tightens the clamp down securely. Works if your vent fins are vertical or horizontal.The middle piece is a ball joint that tightens in place to lock, allowing you to set the angle and orientation of the phone any way you wish.The front piece is the holder. It's securely padded with cushy rubber on the back, sides and bottom, and the bottom holder has a gap so you can plug in your USB or Lightning cable. No more upside down phone. The sides ratchet gently into place as the rubber squashes, holding the phone firmly but without scratching.When it's time to deboard, press the small button and the ratchet slowly opens, releasing the phone without dropping it.I'd buy another one of these if I had to, but it seems sturdy enough that I don't expect to need to for a good long time.
