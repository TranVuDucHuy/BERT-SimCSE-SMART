If this speaker was more expensive I'd give it a 4 star rating since the sound quality is not super, but it does sound SO MUCH better than my iPhone speaker that at the sale price of just $25.35 I'm giving it 5 stars. I hadn't really thought about getting a Bluetooth speaker, but I had been working out 3 days a week at home on my trusty old (20+ years!) Bowflex while listening to music on Radio Paradise (since I don't like ads OR paying for a streaming service) on my iPhone. Then it dawned on me I could probably improve the sound quality significantly at a low cost, and this little gem of a speaker did the trick. Great value for the money. One minor challenge was attaching the included carry strap to the speaker. After a few failed attempts, I finally had to use little pointy tweezers to grasp and retrieve the loop through the mounting bar.
