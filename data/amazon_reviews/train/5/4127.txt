I recommend these ear buds, they work great! I'm completely happy with my purchase and delivery. I am using the ear buds even more than I thought I would. It's relaxing to watch youtube at night with the ear buds and not wake up the other people in my household because I have my computer up too loud. It's been great to also wear them when I want to be hands free on my smart phone. I bought another pair from another company and I prefer these because of the ear clasp that keeps them on my ears. You don't always have to even wear both of them, even one is just fine that way you'll always have one charging, not that you really need to because they stay charged a very long time.
