I literally have this next to me 24/7. I never unplug it ( maybe that isn't the best thing lol), but it never gave me any reason to. It doesn't smoke, or heat up, or anything! Everything charges FAST and there's even a Type C along with 3 USB ports. That's not even including the 3 plugs on top of that! Only thing I'd say is that it'd be nice to have a feature where I can turn it off like your old fashion extension chords. Just so I feel a little better when I leave the house. I knew this before purchasing this product and I still don't regret buying it!
