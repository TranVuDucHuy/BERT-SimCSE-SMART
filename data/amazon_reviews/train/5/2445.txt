I purchased this cable for my PC monitor. It's available in various lengths. The cable provides a superb signal and all my edited photos look fantastic. The cable appears to be made of high quality materials with heavy duty sheathing on the exterior. As I mentioned already, the cable works well. As for reliability, time will tell but I see no reason why it shouldn't give me many years of excellent service. I would recommend this product to a friend.
