My cables are so neatly organized now. Huge audio nerd, so always have so many speaker cables for this and that and the other thing all over the place. Wife, understandably, hates it. It's hideous, but worth the audio for me. Using these shields to hide my cables is a game changer. The house looks so much nicer and neater, I'd never take them down.Few tips:After reading and seeing photos, do not under any circumstances use the tape these came with. It'll ruin your walls. Similarly, don't bother with the dry wall anchors. Unless you're putting a load on these somehow, they should just be funnels for your cables. Don't bother with the anchors, a simple screw will leave a smaller hole and will be easier to install and uninstall.
