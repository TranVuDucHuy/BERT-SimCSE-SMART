I bought eight of these cables with no intention of ever pushing them to 10Gb let alone 40Gb. That being said, I took them to work where we have equipment that can use the 40Gb link at 2Ghz. We did get sustained throughout of at least 35Gb with some 40Gb throughout. I think this was a test limitation rather than cable. All eight cables performed the same. These cables were unaffected by EFI via an old lighting ballast. Cat 6 unshielded cables dropped to near unusable states.Replacing my cabling at home at 2.5Gb from my switch to equipment allows for full 2.5Gb sustained large file transfers without dropping. This is the first time my Killer networking didn't recommend switching from Ethernet to WiFi as I'm now getting full wired bandwidth to my router. While I wasn't experiencing any gaming lag, I feel like I have a better connection with everything else in the house. Remote play from my gaming PC on my office, to a client PC in my living room has shown me the largest improvement. With a 2.5Gb connection between the two, I get zero latency. I'm so happy with this!The quality of these cables are great. Since my home equipment is visible, I wanted everything to look good. They look fantastic.I've seen reviews claiming these aren't Cat 8 because the wire is too small. Wire size isn't part of the Cat 8, 8.1, or 8.2(pending) specifications. Larger wire does not equal more throughput. The wire of these cables are more than ample, so much so they don't feel "hollow" like some cables do. The diameter of the cable is on par with way more expensive cables and it's not done via paper or unnecessary foil shielding.These are great cables.
