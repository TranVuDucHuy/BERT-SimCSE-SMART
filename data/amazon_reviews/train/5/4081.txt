This is the first time I’ve ever left a review but, I would so far say I like the charger. I’ve had it for 2 days now and so far it charges really well. I was contemplating on this device because of the reviews being 50/50 on how well it worked. Thankfully so far the 2 that I bought work just fine. I’d say this charger is best for overnight charging, keep your usual apple charger on hand for throughout the day charging. But once it’s time for bed this charge helps with charging everything at once. I love the simplicity of it and not having 3 different cord chargers all over my night stand. Overall, I’d recommend this charger. Again, it’s a 3 in 1 so don’t expect it to charge everything fast, it’s better for overnight charging than throughout the day.
