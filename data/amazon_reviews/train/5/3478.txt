This one fixes all of the issues I had with the Sony 1000xm4.Bose Pros:Bose are much more comfortable with the deep ear pockets.Multimode is much more reliable and compatible with more phone bluetooth apps.No intermittent connection issues with my computer like the Sony headset.Toggling aware mode with a button press in a noisy environment I don't think will ever get old. Sony makes you hold your hand to your ear the whole time? very strange design.Superior call quality and blocks wind noise better.Sony pros:Sony toggles to computer faster after a phone call. This is also a con, and I think it makes connections back and forth with some apps an issue from being to aggressive switching.Sony noise canceling seems to block slightly more noise, but not really an issue in my environment.
