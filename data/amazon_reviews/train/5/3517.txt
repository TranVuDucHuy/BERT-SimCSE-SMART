I bought this charger stand as a gift to my husband for Christmas- he had just received an Apple Watch and he would be needing a stand.I love this one, it can charge 3 items at once- his phone, watch and iPods . It doesn’t need any extra cords which I love. I charge my phone in a stand with my cord attached, most of the time doesn’t stay in place- I would get one for myself but I like sleeping with my phone under my pillow. Anyway, this 3 in one charger stand is reliable- he places his items on it at night and is always is fully charged and ready to go in the morning. He can also take it when he travels it flattens and is very portable. I highly recommend this one for anyone looking for a great charger stand.
