My cellphone was running out of external memory and add any self-respect ING techie knows, a mobile phone MUST have an SD Card to be better safeguarded against data loss because if the phone gets damaged, you can't access Internal Memory and... would you trust all your photos and documents to a total stranger at a service center? Well, with this I doubled my external memory and the USB 3 adapter is faster than my old adapter. It certainly saves slot of time when doing backups. That's right, you should trust your photos to any cloud backup (which costs ðŸ’°), so NEVER buy a mobile phone without SD Card slot!My older 64GB card is now going to my wife's phone which currently is full at 32GB.
