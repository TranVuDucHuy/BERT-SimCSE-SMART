I very much like the look of this device, it has a nice shape and looks great on my outlet compared to some of the more traditional options. I was a bit surprised to see that it only uses one of the electrical ports, yet still covers them both however this doesn't seem to get in the way of it's functionality, mostly just sturdiness, but it is far from not sturdy. I use this in my kitchen attached to a GFI outlet. I have a toaster plugged in and it hasn't had any problems.
