I've been looking for years for a truly adequate power strip for a geek that has a lot of low draw devices that need to be plugged in at once. This is definitely the one for me. Plenty of wide plugs for the giant wall warts in your life that far too many devices seem to still use, with another six standard plugs. I got it on sale which makes it an even better deal, but it's a very high quality brand (NEVER buy cheap power strips/surge protectors), and it works great.
