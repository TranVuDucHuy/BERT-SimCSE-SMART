I ordered the new generation 1tb SanDisk memory card right after Christmas. First I thought I wouldn't get it till right before or right after new years because there was no way to alter shipping speeds on this purchase so imagine my surprise when it actually came 2 days later. So for that quick turnaround I have to say thank you Amazon. I know you guys were swampedEverything came as expected, the packaging was neither bent nor disturbed. It was fresh off the shelfI bought this for my Nintendo switch and it was simply plug it in and go. Of course I was moving from a 512 gb SanDisk so I had to transfer everything but that's something different. I have no computer so transferring via switch took roughly 10 hours as the 512 gb was completely full. And so was my switch OLED. I'm saying this because out the package I had to test the SanDisk and it's ability to transfer and hold large amounts of data quickly. All went well considering and I got all my games transferred before bedtimeIt has 953 gb free but I knew that so I can't complain and that equates to about 1 dollar for every 10 gbs give or take. My math may be off. So that's good value and I don't have to swap in and out memory cards for different games.All in all I would have to say that this was a good purchase all the way around and it either equaled or exceeded my expectations
