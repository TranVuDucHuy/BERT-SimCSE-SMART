Iâ€™ve only had these cords for a couple weeks, but i honestly have 0 complaints. the cord is long so i love that, it charges my phone just as fast the apple lightning cord, and it seems pretty sturdy. The color (i got purple) is beautiful, over all great product. Will update if i have any problems.
