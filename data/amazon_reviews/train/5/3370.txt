I bought this to expand the kids tablet which was only 16 gigabytes. It was very easy to use. At first I tried to do it under my daughters account and it said the SD card was corrupt but You just have to go to the adult account into the settings and go to storage and then it will prompt you how to use it and it was very easy! I mainly got it so I could download videos and episodes for her for trips when we donâ€™t have Wi-Fi to stream. Works great!!
