I like the size, price and ease of use of this product and it fits into my Bose headphone case too. I thought I would have to purchase a new pair of Bose Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones. Then I remembered to search for an adapter that might work with my iPhone7. I also have an iPod, but had limited space on my last flight. This adapter produced good volume and excellent sound quality.
