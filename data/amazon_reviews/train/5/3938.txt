These little cards are amazing for the price. The pack a lot of storage and speed into such a tiny footprint. These can be used as is, or in the adapter and get the same throughput. I have one camera that uses them as is and two cameras that use them with adapters. I transfer the files to my laptop using the adapter. They work fantastic.
