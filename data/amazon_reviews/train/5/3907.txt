After trying a few other mini BT speakers that did not hold a charge for long, I gave the Musibaby M68 a try based on great reviews. This speaker did not disappoint. I love it so much that I ordered a 2nd one to pair in the hopes of using each speaker in a separate room of our condo. I had no problem pairing the 2 speakers, however the walls in our condo prevented the speakers from working when my iphone moved to a different room. I am enjoying the first speaker very much but had to return the 2nd one since the pairing idea did not work out as planned.
