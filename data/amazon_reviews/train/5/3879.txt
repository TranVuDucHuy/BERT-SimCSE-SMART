First time user, and both the TV wall hanger and the cable management kit by Echogear are AMAZING. Really clear (and funny) instructions that take you step by step. Everything is very well made and it feels super sturdy. I was worried about hanging a big TV on the wall (and my wife was even MORE worried!), but it literally took 30 minutes max, including reading the instructions. It's a 2 person job with a big TV, but you just attach the back brackets, use the included lag bolts to mount the actual hanger, and then you just lift the TV onto the hanger and it hooks on. SUPER EASY. I also ran the power cord for the TV, as well as 3 HDMI cables down through the wall, using the Echogear wire management kit, with no problems, and bang, no more visible cords. I wish every product I purchased was this well designed and easy to use. I was worried, so THANK YOU Echogear for a well designed and easy to use product!
