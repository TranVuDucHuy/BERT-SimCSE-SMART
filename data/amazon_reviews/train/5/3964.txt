I was looking for a classroom speaker that would pack a punch and fill the entire space. This speaker works great in my classroom which is fairly large. It can be turned up loud for presentations, and can be turned down to have study music going. The sound is rich and full. Would highly recommend for those teachers looking for something compact but powerful for their room.
