First the negatives: I wish you could pause/play on the left side earbud as well or reconfigure yourselfPros: I left my right earbud outside in the grass in sub zero weather and this morning took them out and they work perfectly. "Battery Full" lol. Plus the audio is great but not audiophile level which is fine because of the price. This is perfect if your in the gym and just want something wireless and don't want to worry about losing or breaking it. I've got 3 so far because they are so awesome! Battery life is basically the whole day if you evenly use right and left earbud or half a day. Charging only takes like 40ish minutes. All in all this is a great product
