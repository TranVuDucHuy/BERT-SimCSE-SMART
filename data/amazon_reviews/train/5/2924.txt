These covers are tiny! I was worried they wouldn't fit, however they work just fine. I turned my laptop's camera on and placed the cover in the open position and tested the placement first to make sure I was not covering any part of the camera or the camera light before I removed the adhesive backing. This fit on an older (4+years) and a newer (2021) laptop, both HP brand. I like that they are slimmer than other styles as they do not interfere with the laptop closing. The cover slides from open to close easily with a finger. I gave 4 stars for adhesion because they went on really well and seem secure, but I do not know how long they will stay as I just got them.
