Easy to use, safe to use (it is nearly impossible to hurt yourself in it). Doesn’t ruin the paper in the process either. Pouches come in lots of sizes. The only drawback is if you do have to trim the edges, if you get too close to the paper the pouch will open, thus exposing your paper- defeats the whole reason to laminate something. Other than that it is a great product. I have one that’s worked for about 15 years, this was a gift for my daughter who is a teacher.
