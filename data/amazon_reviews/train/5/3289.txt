I needed cables to connect my one laptop to two monitors. A YouTube video used these cables for the connection. The cables weren't mentioned in the video. I purchased them based on they were scene in the video. Now three years later, whenever I need a cable, I order from Warrky. I have never been disappointed. In the past, I have paid for cables just to find out they didn't work as advertised. They work every time. I recommend them to my family and friends. I now have 3 laptops and two monitors connected to a switch. Although the laptops and monitors have changed through the years, Warkky cables has remained constant.
