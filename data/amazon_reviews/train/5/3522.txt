As always when buying an electronic item, you’re on the cautious side (or at least I am). I read all the reviews & knew what to expect, as far as the charging station being on the thinner side & it having the folding capacity (great for travel! My husband went on a work trip & brought his charging station with him). I just have no complaints ! I’m not quite sure if my AirPods 2 (non pro) charge on it, I wouldn’t know how to tell, so I’ve still been using my regular charger, but otherwise it all works great!! I also love that there is a little night light; I personally don’t use the function so I’m glad you can turn it off, but it’s a cute addition.All in all, I couldn’t be happier & it’s such a worthwhile purchase! Especially considering a charging block is $18 now days & this thing can charge three devices !!
