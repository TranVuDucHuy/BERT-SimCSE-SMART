This cable does exactly as is needed while being a solid and cost effective solution. The size is suited to close systems plugs fit snuggly.Unfortunately for myself tbis particular cable ended up not being what I needed at the time for the display setup I have. Running a graphics card with a display, hdmi, and dvi while using a drawing tablet that hogs the one hdi left me restricted on what i can use. Did not realize until after setting up a monitor purchased alongside this that my other display lacked a second hdmi (using as primary display to a Switch).Good choice, great price, make sure to trippl check what you need if you are limited on ports!
