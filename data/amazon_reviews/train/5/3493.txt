These lamination pouches are easy to use and saved my deck of cards! The sheets are sturdy and seem durable.Last week, I accidentally spilled some water near a deck of cards made of cardboard and a few of them were damaged. I wasn't sure whether to keep using them or buy a new set, since I could not find card sleeves large enough for these.The cards were expensive, so my partner suggested I try laminating them to prevent further damage. We'd bought a laminator a few months ago, so I decided to try these pouches to see if I could laminate the cards and they worked!!I did touch up some areas using an iron just to make sure the cards were fully sealed, but I probably didn't need to.These lamination sheets definitely heat better than the ones at my MIL's school, which often have lots of bubbles where the lamination didn't seal properly. If you're a teacher who uses a personal laminator for reference sheets or small items, I recommend these Scotch pouches.I'm happy with how the lamination turned out and plan to laminate some of my other cards and reference sheets to preserve them. The only downside for me is that the lamination made my cards firm, so they can't be shuffled as easily, but it's a minor inconvenience compared to paying $40+ to buy a new set.
