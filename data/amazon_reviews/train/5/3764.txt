Yeah, I accidentally dropped my iPencil and it just obliterated the tip! In desperation i looked online to see if I could get a replacement tip. Some other vendors wanted an arm and a leg for a single tip. But this one had a great review, so I took a chance. Turns out, you don't have to pay an arm and a leg to get quality replacements. BUY IT!
