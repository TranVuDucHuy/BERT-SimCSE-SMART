The suction power on this thing, WOW. I mounted the circle on the dash and just set the mount on it didnâ€™t even lock it in or anything. Well the first way I set it, it was too high up, it was blocking my view out of part of the windshield.. So I needed to un-suction it to turn it around.. Haha good luck with that.. I barely got it off the circle.. Took some serious prying and I almost gave up. Finally got it off and turned around and got the perfect placement.. Now to see if it holds up while driving.. BUT DO NOT EVEN SET THE STICKY PART IN PLACE UNLESS THATS WHERE YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT. Other than that appears to be a really good phone mount.
