We went on a walk around the neighborhood during Christmas and the neighbor had this set up as a option to take pictures with the grinch background and the pictures came out so nice I had to get one. We used our cell phone to take the picture that day, but this one comes with a small remote, I like the remote I just wish it was more substantial to hold. This would also be great for making tick-tock videos taking pictures of items you may want to sell to post or any other fun picture art projects
