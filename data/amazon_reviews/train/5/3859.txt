These are the best lower costing Bluetooth headphones you can find. I feel like the battery lasts a lot longer than they say it does. It charges SUPER fast too so i never worry when they die. They are on sale right now too which is a bonus. I broke mine cause I'm clumsy and dropped them and then stepped on them.... but I bought them with the Asurion protection plan and they gave me a refund and I came right back to buy another pair of the same ones.
