I bought this for when I travel and it’s excellent if you own nothing but Apple products. I wanted to charge a set of ear buds that wasn’t Apple & it would not charge it. So I read the paper that comes with it and right there in black & white it stated that only Apple products will work on this charger other brands will cause it to flash a blue light off & on….that sucks for me because the Apple earbuds don’t work for my ears…they always fall out! So I gave this charger to my grandson he loves it!
