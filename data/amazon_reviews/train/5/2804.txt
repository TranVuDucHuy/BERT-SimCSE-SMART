I am happy with this purchase. My dash cam wouldn't record, because the memory card was past it's usable capacity. I bought this one, for a very good price, and brought my dash cam memory capabilities up to maximum. After formatting the card in the cam, it started recording immediately, and only stops when I shut off the ignition.
