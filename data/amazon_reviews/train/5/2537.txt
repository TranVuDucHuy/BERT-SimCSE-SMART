Very sleek looking. Nice roped cord Plenty of plug ins! However, these cruise ships nowadays, you do not need this. (We were able to get it on board our Norwegian ship.) It's an excellent product and price. It's now on the counter working as our charging base in the kitchen. Hindsight, wish I would have ordered one w a shorter cord. But this was a great purchase.
