Bought this for my wife as she works from home and we have a newborn. She was worried that her coworkers would be able to hear the baby in the other room. After looking for which headset has a noise canceling microphone (which is hard, all reviews talk about noice canceling earphones) , this one showed as the best. So I took a chance a bought it. We did a few test calls and it really does block out a lot of ambient noise! So, good job Voyager. Now all my wifeâ€™s coworkers want one!
