I have done IT work for years. My apartment has area on my back wall where cable comes in and main electric box for hole building or next to each other. The electric box is bleeding huge amounts of EMF and was causing way to much noise to really function. Once I put this in and really taped off both ends problem went away. I tried a bunch hand made and pre packaged even highend outdoor and outdoor cat6e still had the issue till a friend told me about this one. I have to be honest I thought was just BS but it worked.
