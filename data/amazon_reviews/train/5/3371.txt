For those of you that want to use this in a M1 MacBook Pro 14 SD slot, here are the speed numbers that you can probably expect with a generic adapter:SanDisk 1TB Ultra (SDSQUA4-1T00-GN6MA): Write: 22.6 MB/s & Read: 79.2 MB/sThese values vary slightly depending on size of files used on the tests. (See my photo)Note that this card advertises that you can get Read speeds of 120 MB/s. However, keep in mind that those speeds are under ideal conditions and using SanDisk’s own reader that uses a proprietary protocol to achieve that.Realistically, most of us will be using the UHS-I speed of our hardware. In my case on the MBP14, that is 104MB/s for the slot. Without the proprietary Sandisk hardware the speeds are lower and you will most likely see speeds closer to what I have above — so temper your expectations and buy accordingly.
