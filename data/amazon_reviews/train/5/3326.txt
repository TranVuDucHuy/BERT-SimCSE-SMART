I have one of these in all 4 of our vehicles. I have an iphone 13 promax in a case and it still fits in here just fine. My husband has a smaller phone that also fits without issue. I like how this is not only able to rotate your phone from sideways to up/down, but it also has an arm that extends and swivels so you can move it around. It's great for using my phone as a route planner and it's also great to use when I'm talking. There are 'buttons' on each side that you squeeze in to release the phone, and when you put your phone against it those just squeeze in and clip hold of the outside side of your phone to hold it securely in place. I highly recommend this item.
