(Reviewing after second purchase)Awesome all around. There's nothing I love more than a good product, that's reliable and lasts, but is also cheap enough to replace without worry. Similar to the ONN brand wireless earbuds you can get at Walmart, I love these because they're affordable but not cheap, they sound decent, are comfortable, and are easily replaced. So if they get broken 10 days from now by my daughter or just stop working after 10 years of use, I can order another set and not even think about it either way. Yeah, there might be higher-quality headphones out there that have a little more bass and are a little more comfortable, but these aren't the bottom line and they do more than get the job done. The audio quality is clear and by no means bad, the bass won't shake your head but it's there and not clipping, and the comfortability... Comfortability is why I came across these. I tried so many different headphones and all had their reasons to be passed up on but the most common was comfort. I was skeptical about how nice these would feel because of the low price but I can wear these headphones for HOURS and HOURS. My butt will go numb and start to get sore in my somewhat comfortable chair before I even remember these are on my head. Honestly have gotten up and walked away from my desk with them still on more than once because they're soft, they don't squeeze my ears, and they aren't heavy so the headband doesn't dig into the top of my head. I'd like to mention, because it's something I didn't realize at first, that to have one cable with differently sized attachments on either end and then corresponding ports on the headphones, allowing you to utilize 3.5 or 6.35mm audio jacks with the same set of headphones and one cable, is the bomb diggity. Best versatility I've seen in a set of headphones. Long story short, no they're not luxury but they definitely compete with products beyond their price.
