My girlfriend wanted a bluetooth speaker because she wanted to be able to listen to music and podcast using her Amazon Alexa. This little speaker fits the bill perfectly. It's small but sounds surprisingly good. It's got a decent amount of bass and the audio is clear and crisp. It paired up easily with her phone, and I also paired it with our echo dot and that was simple and straightforward as well. The battery life seems good and it doesn't have to be real close to the bluetooth signal source to work. It's rated IPX5 for water resistance, but we haven't had it in the rain or shower yet so can't speak on it's ability to stand up to water. It also doesn't have any flashing lights, but I don't care about that anyways. It sounds good and works well, and to me that's what matters. Overall this is a nice little bluetooth speaker and I would recommend it.
