The sound isn’t superb but at least now I can listen to my audio books and Pandora music clearly. I carry it from room to room while I am working around the house. I love the warning sounds and easy to understand instructions. I got this at such a great price that I have to give it 5 stars. Worth every penny. No more pesky ear buds and now I don’t have to have my iPhone next to body.
