I wanted to use earbuds while im sleeping but was tired of my wireless earbuds dying in the middle of the night, so I decided to buy this here adapter. First one I bought was from Adorama and it worked as expected. I gave it to my brother who got an iPhone 14 so he can continue to use his wired earbuds with a jack-less phone. I bought a second one from the same seller and it also works fine! The first one given to my brother still functions.The adapter is a legit Apple product and the two I’ve received are not counterfeits, as they weren’t rejected by my iPhone and continue to function properly. I’m satisfied with the purchases I made and the product.
