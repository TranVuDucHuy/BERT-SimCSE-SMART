Crisp image, no flickering or other issues. Streams a crystal clear picture. No complaints here! The cord is also thick and durable.(One thing to note - 10 feet was just right for our TV that hangs on the wall. In my head, 6 feet seemed like it would be enough, but when you have the cable there in front of you, it's not long enough to make it to a TV that's up on the wall, unless your console unit is seated close, directly below it). Ended up getting a 10 ft cable in the end, and it's perfect.
