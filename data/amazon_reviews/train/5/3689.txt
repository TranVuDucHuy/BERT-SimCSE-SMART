This is the third brand I've bought to store games on my Nintendo switch and all others end up corrupting data within a day or two. I was afraid it was a Nintendo issue and I'd never be able to have more than 3 or 4 games on there until finally I decided to give this card a try, the day I got it I downloaded every game I had (no issues, finally) and then tested them each to make sure none of them corrupted and finally everything seemed to finally work as I expected when I bought the Switch a year ago. I guess the other two cards were fake or bad and I just have had terrible luck ðŸ˜‚.I've had this card for over a month and still not a single issue has arisen while playing the Switch.
