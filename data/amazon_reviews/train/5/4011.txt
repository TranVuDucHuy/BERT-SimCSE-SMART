I just ordered a few more because I’m obsessed with these and have replaced all other cables with them! I’ve had some for years and they don’t even look damaged. They are very strong and pretty, with a great length but a built-in Velcro strap to shorten when needed. Work fantastically for anything that needs USB to lightning. They haven’t been pierced by sharp kitten teeth even when he tries so that’s an extra plus!
