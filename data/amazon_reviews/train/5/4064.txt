I have purchased this particular ethernet cable twice, the build quality is amazing! It is stiff like a cable wire. I have one connected to my PlayStation 4 Pro and the other to a Samsung smart TV. Both devices are capable of a wifi connection but the ethernet connection provides a more stable connection with virtually no buffering or interference even when online gaming and video streaming on multiple devices at the same time. This cables capable speed is noticeably faster than the average ethernet cord that is provided with most modern modems/routers. Of course, your personal results may vary and are dependent on internet speed. For reference, we have a 200 meg connection and our family has around 30+ devices connected at all times.
