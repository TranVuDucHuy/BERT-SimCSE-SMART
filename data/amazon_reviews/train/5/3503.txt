I made the mistake more than once of buying a cheap brand, including SanDisk, only to have it corrupt, losing everything. I've never had an issue with Samsung cards; I have some that are 6 years old or more that still work. While I think the pricing is steep, it's one of those things I learned to not cut corners on.Otherwise, it's an SD card, and it does what it does. I use them primarily as secondary storage for my tablets, so I can't say how fast/slow the upload/download speed is. Size wise, 265 GB is pretty decent; I have about 2500 ebooks, 50-60 audiobooks, 50-60 movies, and hundreds of photos stored on mine, and there's still plenty of space. I also use APK editors to move all my apps to the SD card, so unless you're downloading tons of larger files, this is a more than enough in terms of size for the average user.Just to clarify, bc I read a few reviews that complained about it not showing the full 265 GB once formatted, that's normal. It's a combination of formatting using some space, variations in GB as a standard unit of measurement, and the type of formatting you (or your device default) does.
