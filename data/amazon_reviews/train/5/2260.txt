Cell phone stand is sturdy metal. Had to "modify" for teleworking use so phone not move around and stand not try to tip backwards when tapping buttons: secured phone to holder with couple rubber bands (one at top holder which was about middle phone, another at bottom) which held snug but allowed access to phone controls and held securing using plugged in headset; weighted base with small bag filled with pennies (1 pound worth). These modifications kept the phone/holder from moving around during teleworking.
