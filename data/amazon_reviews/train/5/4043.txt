For high sensitivity to sound, these will dampen most irritating noises to a tolerable level. They're comfortable enough wear for an hour, maybe two, I'm very sensitive to that as well. Worth every penny from my limited budget to get a little relief from sensory overload for a while. I'd buy the really expensive ones if I could, but these will do. Mostly I use these to take the edge off when I'm overstimulated. I can still hear the fridge compressor and a noisy fan, but it's enough. Audio books, podcasts and music are fine, especially with the extraneous sounds dampened so well.There was a problem with the touch sensor on the right bud after just a week or so, and after a few days of tech support trials and communications they opted to send me a new pair. Obviously it was inconvenient and disappointing, but the resolution was smooth.As far as listening to things or taking phone calls, they're fine as well. I'm not great at remembering the various touch patterns to reject/answer a call or change the volume etc. They'll disconnect from your device around 20 feet. I can't wear them long enough to run out of battery. A full charge on the case will vary, but has indicator lights.The new pair they sent hasn't had any problems at all.
