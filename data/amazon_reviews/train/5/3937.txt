What more can you ask for? I want reliable storage in an SD card, that's it. I trust a card to hold my images so it has to work and it has to be well made; that's the key point with micro SD cards, they're so small and in my mind more fragile so they really have to be well made and these are. The Samsung cards are perfect in that regard. Yes, there are countless other brands out there but I trust Samsung. The best SD cards should be something you think about, they should simply do what they're supposed to do, and this one does. Definitely recommend these.
