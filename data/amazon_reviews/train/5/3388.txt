It’s definitely cheaper than investing in an Apple Pen. I think this pen is great. I’m not sure how long the battery lasts, but it definitely lasts at least a full two days. Depending how often you use it. I use to to draw. By the way there’s this app called Sketch for the IPad and iPhone. You can use with this pen. Just have to pay a one time fee of 1.99. You get unlimited colors. To sum up what I’m trying to say, is buy this pen if you are the artistic type or just want to write with a pen. It’s a good starter for those who don’t know if they’ll use it. Definitely before you buy an Apple pen.
