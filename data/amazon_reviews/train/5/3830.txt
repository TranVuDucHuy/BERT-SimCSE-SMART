i was a little bit skeptical at first because i had never bought a refurbished apple product before but i didnt want to spend the almost $300 when i could get it for $150ish. it shipped really really fast like i literally got it 2 days after i bought it and i didnt even pay for the expedited shipping. The noise cancellation works perfectly and the airpods are in perfect condition and it even came in the original box so you could totally gift these to someone else. The only thing tho that i didnt like was that when you try to connect it to your find my iphone app it says that there's a part missing which is prohibiting it from connecting but that's honestly the only thing wrong with it.
