I use this for my Apple Watch. I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews about them getting hot or not working. They have worked better than the one that came with the watch, plug into a USB port, which could not be easier, and they charge the watch quickly. I'll probably buy another to keep in my computer bag for when I travel. Excellent for the money.
