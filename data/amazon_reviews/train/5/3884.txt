Very impressed with the product, loved the template, granted I was nervous hanging the QN90B Samsung Neo QLED 4K HDR Smart TV, weighing in at 98 lbs. (mount is rated for 125 lbs., no worries, but until it was up and hanging, I was worried) The mount was easy to install, leveled it, had to get my brother to help lift the 85-inch TV up onto the mount. He was quick to point out it was not level, as I had leveled the mount, but the ability to adjust it to level once on the wall made for a phenomenal product. loosened a couple hex head bolts and was able to adjust it to spot on level. so glad the ability was built into the unit. Very happy with it and would strongly recommend it, especially if hanging a 85-inch tv, the flexibility of being able to pull the TV out from the wall and easily add or remove cables is great too!
