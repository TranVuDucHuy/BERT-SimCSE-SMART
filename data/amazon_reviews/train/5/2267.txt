Don’t have any pictures because it was a gift for my boyfriend. My boyfriend tried it out for the first time last night and loved it. Instead of having to propping up his phone all the time and taping his charging cord, I got him this stand. It is also nice because you can have it on the stand while charging your phone. It always gets annoying when you’re FaceTiming someone and then you have to charge your phone and you can’t see each others face. Really recommend this.
