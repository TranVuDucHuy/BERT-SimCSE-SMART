Pretty pale pink color and a variety of ear tips to customize the fit. Once I tried out the tips, I selected the ones that fit best and they stay put! Even on my runs they don't fall out. Decent noise cancellation -- when they're both in, I can hear my audio very clearly. I'm not a big audiophile, so I think the audio quality is great! Especially for the price. The only slight drawback is the charger. It uses the old fashioned android type charger so if you lose it (it's quite a short charging cable, only about 6 inches long) then you might not have a replacement lying around. Otherwise, it's excellent. Budget friendly, portable, lasts a long time without charging, and doesn't fall out of your ears after you pick the right ear tips.I actually bought this again since I lost the charger for the pink one. I was going to buy a replacement charger, but for $15 I could just get a new earbud set so I went with the new earbuds option. I bought the black version and the charger for the black one is the same charger that's used for the Samsung S21 (the USB-C type charger) which is the type of phone I have. Extreme convenience right there. If losing the charger is a concern for you, I would recommend choosing this same S8 model, just the black color (also the black color is $10 cheaper than the pink at the time of this review).
