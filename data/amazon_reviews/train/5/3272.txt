It works without any issues. Its 1.2 so if you need a 1.4 see newer model. It fits snugly into both the video card port and the monitor port without those bothersome locks. (Try to detach one after it locks - the struggle of tge century).The big issue with a dp cable is pin 20. If your video card was introduced before 2017 (5 years) an active pin 20 will prevent your monitor from recognizing your video card because of power feedback. You need to shut iff monitor then restart. Inconvenient not mention potentially damaging to your monitor. This ivanky cable is Definitely not active on pin 20 preventing that issue. This fact is contrary to other reviews, published on the ivanky website. My actusl use confirms that.Also this cable has aluminum end caps. Another review has stated that it gets hot. I can only assume that reviewer has other system issues because it does not get hot.I believe these 2 features were important to mention as other mis-information might alter a shoppers opinion.So if you need an inactive pin 20, a 1.2 standard, and a reliable safe product this will work nicely.
