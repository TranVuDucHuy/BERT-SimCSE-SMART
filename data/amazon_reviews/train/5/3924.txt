I would like to state first and foremost that I am not a professional DJ and don't own a license. I have been mixing music for a few years just to keep music that I have enjoyed fresh and exciting and revived from being overplayed.I make music strictly for my own enjoyment and possibly enjoyment for others. I have been on the quest to find equipment that can handle my needs and had been suffering from equipment that cannot. You see I make experimental beats that frequently destroy equipment and sound cards aplenty. I have to date destroyed about five soundcards and five headphones/speakers before discovering these headphones. I have run these through every conceivable series of sounds that would normally blow any other headphone pretty much instantaneously, or within a week at most. I've owned these for about six months. In that time I've destroyed the two cables it has come with and had to buy a replacement but the headphones are fine. I find that i am starting to recommend these to others to hear my tunes the way it had been made in the first place. I have nothing to say bad about these headphones. Had I not discovered them, I would have not been able to affordably make music due to the rate i was destroying equipment.Pros:+Lightweight and no fake lead weights for premium feel.+No frills sound and fidelity+ The looseness doesnt cause discomfort when worn+Packs easily for storage+Wide vocal range+ Inexpensive and cost-effective+ Good noise-cancellingCons:Cables included are long but will be blown in about a week listening to my tunes, I consider them cheaply made.Final thoughts:If you are looking for a reasonably priced, long lasting set of headphones capable of listening to tunes from your library, personal collection, or even music from others, look no further.
