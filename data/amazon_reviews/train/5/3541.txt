I ordered 2 since my a7iii takes 2 memory cards. Decided it was time to get new ones since it’s been about 4 years since I’ve replaced mine. SD cards tend to go bad after continuous use and can end up corrupting files. Its always better to be safe than sorry! Also the cards come with Sandisk memory recovery which is a huge plus!!!
