Right now, I must own at least four different kinds of earbuds, ranging from Samsung Earbuds Pro to Sennheiser Momentum to Soundcore Life P3, and so on.I am in the airline business, and frequent travel is a must. My go-to headphones for travel are the Sony WH-1000XM4. They are over-the-ear and excellent in ANC and battery life.However, I also wanted in-ear buds with decent ANC for workouts and airplane rides when my over-the-ear phones got tiresome or on shorter trips.Here is my problem: the creator decided to bless me with ear canals, the size you can stick your thumb in. So none of the before-mentioned buds, with their included silicone tips, fit and sealed my ear canals. The result was hardly any ANC and a tiny sound with no bass. The only thing that would work for me is to purchase the largest Comply Foam Tips. They would work better, but now the Earbuds would not fit in their charging case, having me take the foam tips on and off every time I used them, making it a constant pain.The Bose from the start sounded way better than the rest, and after trying out all the options of buds and bands, with all sorts of different insert techniques (frustration city), I found a combination with the large buds and small bands to get a somewhat decent seal. The test in the app showed green on both buds, but the ANC still had no "wow" factor. Running the vacuum was way louder compared to my Sony over-the-ears.When I ordered the Bose Quiet Comfort II, I also had the foresight to order the separate XS and XL earbud kit. It arrived today, and after installing the XL Ear Buds, it has become a game changer. "WOW" all the way. Super ANC (the noise running the vacuum is almost not present) and a vast improvement in the sound quality. These are now right up there with my Sony WH-1000XM4.There finally is peace, and the search is over.If you have similar issues, buy these earphones and get the additional earplugs kit.
