Needing a portable BT speaker was something that I needed (as opposed to wanted). I soak in my tub regularly; I do projects in my garage regularly and I hang out on my lanai regularly. In other words, I needed an easily portable speaker. And since I’m always listening to a book or music, The tinny sound from my iPad or iPhone was tolerable. Just barely. my AirPods were great at sound canceling, but in those situations it wasn’t necessary. Hence began the search for a speaker that filled my requirements but also had a great sound. To say my flabber was gasted at the amazing sound that MUSIBABY put out, but I’d be remised if I neglected to share that the base is stunning. Do not hesitate to purchase your very own MUSIBABY. It’s an excellent value. Yet truth be told, I’d purchase it if the cost was higher. By shhhhhh! Don’t tell the sellers!Lightning fast shipping. It arrived in excellent condition. It took me all of six minutes to have it operational!Oh….I opted for the red…it’s just kinda a fun color!
