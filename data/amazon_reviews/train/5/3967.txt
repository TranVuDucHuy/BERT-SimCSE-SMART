I bought this speaker originally as a present for my sister's iPod use. All through December we played Christmas music everywhere in the house for hours on end (without a plug and using bluetooth). It worked great. The sound was loud as our stereo and very clear. No hums or metallic sounds.At Christmas this year, I bought 2 more, for a laptop with a lousy speaker system and an mpg player with a book on tape. Both the quiet spoken word and low-woofer symphonic music sounds perfect on this device. I highly recommend.
