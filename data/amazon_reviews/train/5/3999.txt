My gimbal selfie stick broke. Decided to buy this one. When comparing to my old gimbal, I realized that I didn't really need a gimbal. The length of this tripod is much longer than my old gimbal which help me get a better angle of the shot. No extra application needed. The Bluetooth remote has a long range, although I didn't test how far it'll actually work. The tripod stand and the base has a good weight for balancing when extended fully. It could feel heavy if you hold it for a long time, but I used it as a tripod most of the time so it doesn't really bother me.
