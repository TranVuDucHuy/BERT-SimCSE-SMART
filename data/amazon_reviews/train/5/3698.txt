This has replaced my Apple USB-C adapter (very big, bulky and heavy...kind of overkill for most uses) to connect HDMI to my iPad Pro. I use this repeatedly for presentations where I connect to HDMI on projectors or large TVs. While everyone has a spare HDMI cable no one ever has a HDMI to USB-C adapter, so picking up a cheap quality adapter is a smart move. The adapter is more durable than Apple's connector as it is sleek, streamlined and also uses a high quality braided cord attached to the actual adapter. This adapter is the same high quality that I have experience with my other Anker products.
