Okay so I read alot of reviews saying there was stuttering when writing or drawing it kinda shows you guys don't know that you need to change out the tip of the pen. Once you change out the tip of the stylus the stuttering stops and the only time it starts is when your stylus nib is worn down. In short if you want a good stylus this one is wonderful as long as you change out the nib with a new one when it starts to stutter. I have had zero problems with this stylus since I bought itâ™¡
