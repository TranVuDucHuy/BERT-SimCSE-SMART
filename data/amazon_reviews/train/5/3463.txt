I purchased these headphones after having a few unsuccessful pairs that just either didn't sound good, or didn't work properly. I spend a lot of time trying to find a pair that was going to sound good for the budget I had. As well as have a good build to them, and that they will last.These have exceeded expectations! They feel great on the head. Snug but not enough to cause pressure meaning that they stay put! Walking, sitting or lying down, I don't have to do much adjusting if at all. Setup was very easy and unlike the previous headphones I had, they reconnect quickly without fail. I don't have to constantly check the Bluetooth settings on my device to make sure I'm good to go. The button layout was really easy to figure out and they are placed well. Nothing feels awkward as far as turning off NC or changing volume. I love when I turn them on, I get the power on sound, battery level, and connected sound so I know I am good to go. NC is set to be on when you turn them on and has its own dedicated button to turn it off and on. This feature works well. I tested it accidentally when my cat was purring next to me, I couldn't hear her or the fan in the room.They sound great, not for their price but in general! There is a bass boost feature but it is not needed as these do a great job giving that punch and rumble without it being distorted or overbearing. I can still hear vocals, mids, and highs just as clearly. I am no expert but my ears are just delighted by these so far. Nothing sounds muddy or robotic due to a weak signal. Tv shows, movies and music all sound great here.Battery level has so far matched what has been advertised. A charge last a long while, even with NC on. Only thing I haven't tried is using these in AUX mode since it comes with a cable. All my devices no longer have an AUX port to test with.Overall an excellent pair of headphones that exceed expectations and value!
