We bought two of these for our bedside tables and chose the one with the short (5') cord, since that was all we needed. I guess you could travel with these things (that's one of the star categories for the rating), but that's not what we got them for and they seem kinda large for that.Putting an even finer point on it, being suitable for traveling would be a disadvantage for our use. So that category is not applicable.What is applicable is that these outlets are very convenient, taking the place of multiple chargers. Having a USB-C connector for one of the outlets is also convenient.
