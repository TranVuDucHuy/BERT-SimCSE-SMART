It's easy to install, just plug it in an existing 110-120V outlet and you have access to 5 110V outlets and 4 USB ports. The outlets are surge protected and a green light showing power and surge protection. Outlets are spaced out nicely to allow plugin connections of different sizes.The down sides are (1) when removing device plugins you need to apply some pressure to the wall charger to keep it from loosening or coming out of the reciprocal. (2) the portability is ok for moving from one reciprocal to another in my house but I wouldn't recommend taking it on a plane as you might have a difficult time getting through security if stored in a carry-on and might get damaged in a checked bag. If traveling to another country, you need to check what their voltage is and don't use if theirs is 220V.Otherwise it works great and makes a great addition to any room for additional outlets with surge protection and multiple USB charging ports. I highly recommend this device.
