I have honestly used a few these over my time and have always been impressed with their packaging, design, combability, and performance. They package them so well. For most cables they send them in a plastic wrapped box, two twist ties to ensure the cable stays properly wrapped and protectors on the ends of each cable. These are easy to remove as you hold the pin on the end of the cable about half way down and they slid right off without preventing damage to cable. Perfect. They are also weather resistant and provide extremely efficient shielding and design.
