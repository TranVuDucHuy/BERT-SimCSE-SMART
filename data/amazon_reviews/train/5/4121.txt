With the hybrid workplace now a part of the norm, I started seeing issues engaging all team members in meetings—when on location with remote workers. I had to find a technology that would bridge the gap. Last fall, I attended a conference, and they used the Meeting Owl. It was used in a conference setting, but I could see how it could be used with hybrid teams.--I had to try it out.Set up was easy and fast. Our remote team members are now experiencing a deeper level of engagement given anytime someone speaks, they are focused on and given equal billing. We can talk to contributors individually, and it’s easier to read the room on both internal and client calls. The level of inclusiveness is better than any other technology I’ve seen out there. I’m looking forward to recommending this product across the organization and I highly recommend it for a hybrid working environment.
