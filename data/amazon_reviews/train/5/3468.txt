Sound you would expect from headphones a lot more expensive. I'm 68 years old, I started listening to music on giant speakers and corded headphones. I've never had a really "top end" set of headphones but I've had several mid-level sets and I've never had a set that came closer to the depth of sound you get with corded headphones than these do. Spatial centering is perfect, making it sound like you're center stage front row. The bass is excellent, a bit boomy, I actually turned it down a bit. Physical comfort is ok, average. You wouldn't want to try to do vigorous exercise in them but mild activity is not a problem. I wear them on my rowing machine. They do get a bit hot and stuffy after two hours or so but I rarely want to wear them that long.I can't speak to longegivity yet but they appear sturdy and well constructed. I haven't tested the play time but I've had them a month and only charged them once, when I got them.All in all, I can't imagine how a more expensive set could be enough better to justify the price. Maybe for a pro, someone with a perfect ear maybe, but for us ordinary mortals these are plenty good enough.
