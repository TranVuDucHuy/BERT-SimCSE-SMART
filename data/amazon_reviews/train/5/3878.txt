This is a really solid TV mount with great features. I only wish I had both it and my TV in hand before I had to place my electrical box in the wall during construction. The combination of TV mounting points and available mounting holes in the rails forced me to put this much lower on my wall than I wanted. So far though that hasn’t been an issue and my 65” Sony TV is still right where I wanted it. Just something to consider if you are working on new space / blank wall, put the TV mount up first, then use an old work box to place your outlet and chase the wires down to the floor.
