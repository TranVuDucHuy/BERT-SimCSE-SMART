Listening to these right now ATM. Genuinely really good sound quality without having too much bass, just the right amount for my ears. Good spectrum between both joined together. Had it paired within 2-3 seconds and they worked immediately. Had to press the outside right one to get both on at same time. I'm completely new to this tech.Came almost full charged and only took about 2-3 minutes for full charge. Tested it out with spoken voice first, very good and now trying it out with music (Grand Funk Railroad I'm You're Captain) really great sound quality. Good signal for up to about 20' which is plenty enough for me. Better than my Razer gaming headset! Better sound quality too and for half the money. Fully waterproof as well, tested them in my sink. You really don't even notice they're in at all. Used the earbuds that came installed originally and they fit perfectly even with rigorous activity they stay put which I absolutely appreciate.The charging case is super small which makes it very convenient and fits in any pocket pretty comfortably sort of about the same size as a set of keys. Very lightweight too which makes long-term carry time even better. The only thing I haven't tested yet is the call features which I'll try later but that's really not what I bought these for but is a nice additional capability. As far as noise cancelling they're actually great too without having to pump the volume to ridiculous levels.Comes with two small booklets, one for quick operations and one with details for music use and call use. If you prefer a lot of bass these may not quite be for your taste but given the cost they're tough to beat. Higher volume than say what you'd normally hear in a room you get a bit of clipping and distortion for music. For voice, you can turn them up pretty loud.No question about it for me, they're definitely worth the money and will serve my needs for a very modest price!!! Definitely recommend these!
