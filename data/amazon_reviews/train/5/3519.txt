I hate clutter and am always looking for ways to organize things. I was getting tired of looking at 3 different charging cords on my nightstand that were always getting tangled and looking messy. I found this incredibly convenient 3-in-1 charger and I'm so pleased with it! It looks so sleek and doesn't take up much space on my nightstand. I like that the stand folds so I can bring it on trips. Everything does seem to charge pretty quickly, however I usually just place all 3 of my devices on it before bed so that's not a concern for me. I like that everything charges via magnets for quick placement or grab and go, you don't have to fumble with the port. There's a blue light function that I haven't seen a need for but luckily you can turn it off. I looked at many 3-in-1 chargers but I'm glad I went with this one! Would highly recommend.
