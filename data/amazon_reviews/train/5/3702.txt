Why five stars? No, it doesn't work on our top of the line high powered Windows 10 gaming Laptop. BUT the customer service folks were great. They shipped a replacement for Me to test which arrived the day after the first, and they sent two shipping labels for Me to sent both units back when they didn't work for Me and they gave Me a full refund. Can't ask for better customer service than that. I would buy from Anker again.
