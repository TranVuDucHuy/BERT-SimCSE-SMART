These were a Christmas present for my son, 15. His first pair. I am afraid of him losing them, but that's on him. Not sure if it's his age and he simply ignores me when I'm speaking to him or the ear phones, which I can't always tell that he's wearing, but the noise cancellation seems to be working. He loves them and has been taking good care of them. Great present, great price.
