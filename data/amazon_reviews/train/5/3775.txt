I was going to title this great earbuds for the price - but truly, these are just great earbuds. I bought them at 50% off however I would’ve been more than willing to pay full price if I knew the quality I was getting. The connection process is quick and easy, just follow the included set-up guide. Besides that, I haven’t had any issues and have really enjoyed the earbuds. The noise cancellation, while not an included feature, is a feature. I barely turn the volume up one notch and every other noise disappears. It is worthwhile to try different earpieces to best fit your ears. Additionally, the sound quality is second to none for the average user and the different levels can be distinctly heard no matter at what volume. No notes on longevity since I haven’t had these for long but so far, 5/5.
