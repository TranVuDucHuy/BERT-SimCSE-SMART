I have tried a few of these and this is the best. You may need to get someone with smaller fingers to help tighten it when you first put it on but once it's on, it's not going to fall off because of the way it's designed. Unlike other mounts I've tried I was able to get this on my vent without feeling like I'm blocking a ton of the vent. True one hand use - easy to put your phone in and take out and it's secure. I turned off my 'squeeze to assist' (which I never use anyway) because it sets that off occasionally when I first put it in but that's easy to dismiss. Once I dismiss it, it doesn't continue to engage. Highly recommend.
