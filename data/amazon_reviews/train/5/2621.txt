This is the 4th wall mount I've installed for personal use. Mounted a 65", 50 lb TV with this mount.Pic 1 shows the nice mounts for the back of the TV, 2 long vertical rails that hook on the wall mount, each has a long cap screw that screws up to lock it to the wall mount. The tilt feature is controlled by cap screws at the top of the mount and has a nice range of movement.Pic 2-3 show the top and bottom mount rails, the center hole is a perfect circle, it comes with 4 lag screws to mount it, I added a 5th starting with the center top for the correct height and center for the wall, which allowed me to easily level the mount and mark the four secure points. I left the 5th lag bolt in just for extra strength since I live in Earthquake area.Pic 4 shows how far the TV can pull away from the wall and be angled for viewing from other positions. The mounts moves easily and you can still feel how solid it is, extremely please with this mount and for the cost it is a solid value.
