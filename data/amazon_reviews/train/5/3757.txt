I never dreamt that breaking the tip of my Apple Pencil 2 would come close to costing me the entire pencil. The reason this cheap part almost cost me my pencil was that the end of the tip opposite the point (the part that screws on inside the shaft) broke off deep inside the shaft of the pencil. That threaded piece of the tip was still screwed inside the shaft of the pencil and it was impossible to reach by finger. Look for YouTube videos on how to fix your pencil if this should happen to you. And don't make the mistake I made of assuming you can fix it easily. I used a drafting compass with metal pins in each end as a pincer and ended up almost destroying the plastic end of the shaft. It's hard to do. Get the tool you'll see recommended and don't try to jury rig your way through the fix. Fortunately, I did get the remainder unscrewed. Doing so resulted in some ugly deformation of the plastic at the end of the shaft, but it worked with the new tips.BTW, I got a second Apple Pencil at the Apple Store last week and the guys at the store said if the tip ever breaks inside the shaft again, bring it into the store and let their tech support fix it. They said you probably won't be charged to get it out and if they break it, it's on them. They said, "Don't even try to do it yourself. Bring it straight to the store." I think this is worth knowing.
