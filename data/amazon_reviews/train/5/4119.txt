My teams of been experiencing group meeting (Zoom, Teams, google) fatigue. Given the scope of our often “group project” based meetings to cover updates, we had people call in from respective offices vs meeting using our meeting rooms. We bought an OWL system to enable out teams to meet and share space with distance teams int he most functional mannerThe Owl system was so simples to install, plug it in, initiate the system and you are off and running on your zoom meeting.The system allows multiple people in our meeting room to be on one line, speak watch and focus on the meeting, allowing the pertinent person to be the area of focus as they present. The camera is amazing, the sound is super clear!This system made the meetings fun, functional and will allow our in person and remote teams greater ease and access to each other, a win for us in productivity and connectivity.The 360-degree camera works flawlessly, this a “must have” for meetings to enhance cross functionality.I recommend the OWL system, you will wonder why you didn’t have the OWL before, we will be buying these at each remote office.
