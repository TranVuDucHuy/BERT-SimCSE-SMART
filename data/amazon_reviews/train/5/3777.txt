I purchased this mount to hang a 50” LG TV on the wall in my newly refinished game room. I was able to center it perfectly on the wall and it looks great! Installation was fairly straight forward. I would recommend tightening the screw that needs loosened to tilt the TV forward before you hang the TV on the mount. I didn’t do it and the TV lurched forward before it was fully attached to the mount! Luckily, it remained on the mount and it wasn’t a big deal. Just made my heart stop for a second. LOL! Overall, the mount works great and seems to be of excellent quality! I’d recommend it!
