My daughter has an ipad and was begging for the apple pen, but with the high price it seemed a little out of reach for a seven year old to use. I did my research and came across this pencil, read the reviews, and for the price figured why not!The pen arrived and it is great! Apple has a feature for "apple pen" making the set up super easy. All I had to do was go into settings and make sure this option was on, make sure pencil is on, and it worked immediately.The size of the pencil makes it comfortable to use without any issues. I tried using it to make sure there were no issues with the touch or connectivity and there wasn't. This pencil is great for writing and drawing! My daughter even uses it when playing games on the ipad.The price is also much more affordable which you can't beat! It comes with a charging wire and several other writing tips. We are very happy with our purchase.
