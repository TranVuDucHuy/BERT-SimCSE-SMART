These are the best sound quality, best battery life, easiest charge & compact carry. The only issue I've had is that once they're paired with one device, you can't switch it to another without first unpairing from previous device. Example, my daughter borrowed them & I had to wake her up & have her unlock her phone to unpair buds before I could use them with my phone- even though they were recognized by my device.Besides that issue, the overall best value in quality for the price. I consider them "off brand Beats", they look similar & have the best sound I've found in the MANY different brands I've tried. Great noise cancelation, and they've never fallen out. I have small ears & the smallest inserts work for me. They come with 3 alternative size adjusting pads along with the original ones that are on buds when you open the box.They always arrive within a day or two.There is a strong magnet to keep them in the case, also you can use 1 bud at a time, independently, to prolong battery time. The case provides an additional charge, so this is great when you're on the go. I would recommend these highly to anyone that doesn't want to overspend on something easily misplaced or lost by kids. Loud sound for music, perfect for podcasts. I don't use them for phone calls, so can't attest to call quality, but I believe they can be used for this purpose.
