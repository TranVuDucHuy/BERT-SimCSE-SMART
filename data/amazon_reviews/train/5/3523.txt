I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we absolutely LOVE it! We currently have it in our kitchen so whenever we need something charged we can just sit it on the stand. My husband and I also want one for each of our night stands as well. It’s so convenient and with only one cord, it keeps your space looking clean and organized. Im sure I’m not the only one that hates having 100 cords everywhere. They get tangled or you have to find a plug in for the cord or a cord for the plug in…it’s so annoying. With the wireless charging station you don’t have to unplug something to plug another thing in, you can charge your watch, AirPods, and your phone all at once and with ONLY ONE CORD!!!The ONLY thing (and I mean only thing) is I wish it charged my devices a little faster but overall this product is amazing and if your thinking about getting it well…GET IT! You won’t regret it!
