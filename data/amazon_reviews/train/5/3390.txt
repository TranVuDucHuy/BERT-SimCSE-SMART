I have bought three of these for my kids to replace Apple Pencils that they lost for school. They perform very well, and especially for the cost versus a real Apple Pencil. Recharging is fast and easy using an USB-C connection. We prefer this to the style that has the lightning connection protruding from the end because it stays out of your way while charging. I’m sure my kids will lose another one but I don’t have to pay $100 to get a true Apple Pencil because these do just fine.
