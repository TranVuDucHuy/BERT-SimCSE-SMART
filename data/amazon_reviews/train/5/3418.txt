I bought this item because my newest phone can only use C to C charging whereas previous phones could use regular USB chargers. I've had to switch everything over, including my car charger. Packaged very well and arrived in good condition. It seems very sturdy and well made u believe that it's too bulky for a short trip but fine for the house or a long summer vacation. I would recommend this item but not for a quick trip.
