I've had Bose noise cancelling phones for years and they're ideal for traveling, which I do a lot of. They effectively block extraneous sound including road and plane roar, and have a warm full sound with plenty of bass, which is much appreciated by a bass player like me. I recently and regretfully left mine on a plane. The silver lining is that this newer model is bluetooth and rechargeable which are generally great conveniences. The one odd drawback to the bluetooth is that it doesn't really function with digital editing software like Digital Performer; you have to turn them off and plug in the provided cable, and sound quality is crappy. A very helpful feature is the "aware" option - when you push that button you can hear some ambient sound around you. This can be a good safety feature at times, but for me, it allows me to practice my bass with music and not have to take one headphone off to hear my own bass, which is normally cancelled out.
