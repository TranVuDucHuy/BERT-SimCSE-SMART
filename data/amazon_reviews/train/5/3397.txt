I ordered one of those 2/pac Chinese knockoffs last year and one worked a few times... can't find the other! At any rate... Too late to return, and now having purchased an iphone11pro this past year (I don't give up my prior iPhones easily :)) I have had to start using ear buds more. Chose to go with an actual iphone extender thing. So of course it's made well, works just fine and worth the price of $12 to get it.
