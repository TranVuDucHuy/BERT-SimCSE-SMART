Bought for a friend for Christmas. She could do videos of her dog in action while she was training her. Now she sets it up an keeps remote in pocket to start when she is ready. She loves it!She is a very active 85 year old woman, and not to savvy when it comes to electronics. But this was so easy for her to use once I installed the app on her phone.
