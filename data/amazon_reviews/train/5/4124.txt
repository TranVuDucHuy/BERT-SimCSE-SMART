This is my response letter to the Bmani Company for T16 Earbuds:Thank you Daren it worked (refund instructions). I learned something new today. I'm sorry your earbuds wasn't a good fit for me. However, in the future if you could add earbuds that pair multiple devices, and tweak in a little more bass, I'm your user. Thanks again for the refund & earbuds. I will write a postive review about your awesome company regarding your company's integrity and resolve.Blessings,DeborahThe T16 Earbuds could not paired or toggle between multiple devices. In other words one moment I'm using the ear buds to watch TV, then I switch to another deviceusing the same earbuds to listen to music. It will not allow me to do both like my other Bluetooth devices. To show you how honorable this company is, they suggested a full refund and I can keep the earbuds. This was the ultimate for me, as soon as they can add that feature to pair multiple devices, tweak in a little more bass I'm your lady user.Thank you Bmani Company, you have awesome & legendary customer service rep's working for you!
