Although the product seemed to be ok, "help@hussel.net" appears to be bogus when emailed to ask a simple question regarding the product. Email came back "undeliverable". This would be an issue if it was necessary to contact their customer support for help regarding something more important, such as warranty assistance. Buyer beware.
