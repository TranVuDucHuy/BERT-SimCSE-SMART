You won't have a hard time with this pulling out of the socket. It was a workout just getting it inserted.It was meant to replace an original Samsung charger (QC 2) but appears to be slower than the original Samsung product.I'm going to have to time both to get actual metrics but the Samsung is obviously quicker. Not too much of a deal breaker but extremely annoying when I need a full charge.
