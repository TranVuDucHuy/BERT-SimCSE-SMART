Let’s start with WHY this was a five star product: I bought it before the LTT Screwdriver existed.Post LTT Screwdriver the included screwdriver feels like cheap junk and the magnetism of the iFixit bits are NOWHERE NEAR as good. That said, the iFixit bits work with any screwdriver, so it’s not a total loss.IFixit, if you’re reading this, IMPROVE YOUR BIT’S MAGNETISM!!! The #1 issue I have with iFixit is how easily the motherboard screws fall off as I’m trying to mount the darn thing.Aside from magnetism issues, the variety of bits is quite good, the bits are solid and work well enough for most applications…just don’t count on it when installing a motherboard or M.2 drive in an older motherboard with the screw-in locking mechanism.
