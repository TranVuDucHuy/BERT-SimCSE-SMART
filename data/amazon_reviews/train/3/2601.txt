Great amount of bits, weak magnet, weird frictional grind (with my driver - maybe a QC issue?), labels extremely hard to see, but overall a decent kit that I think should be priced more around $24.99-29.99.I guess the appeal is the convenience of it all. It's all in one nice container and takes up very little space.Personally, I think I would have tried out one of the $18 kits ( https://www.amazon.com/Screwdriver-Trekoo-Precision-Professional-electronic/dp/B07GWS5G3R ) if I could do it over. The hand driver doesn't look as nice, but the labeling is actual legible and way better priced.I guess what people are paying for is the iFixit brand.
