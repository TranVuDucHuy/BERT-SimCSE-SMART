I mainly bought this kit primarily to fix my Steam controller but also to serve as an all purpose tool repair kit for other small electronics.The quality is generally good. I've purchased similar drill bit sets from eBay (for about $5) and the quality of the metal was not as good (to be expected). I haven't been using the set too much but I haven't noticed any wearing on the heads. The only complaint I have is that the case doesn't feel particularly sturdy and the bits are held in place by a tough fabric. I'm afraid this fabric may wear over time and is not particularly tight so bits may fall out quite easily if you're not careful. I love that they included a grid with the cover so that it can double as a screw organizer.I also appreciate that the regular handle has magnets so that screws can latch on if you accidentally drop them. The magnet could be a little stronger though. The 150 mm extension does not have a magnet and needs to have the bits pressed in firmly. This can get a little tricky with some of the pointy bits because you need to firmly grip the sides rather than press down on the top (unless you don't mind hurting your fingers). It'd be great if future versions included a magnet in the extensions.Lastly, the main reason I gave the product 3 stars rather than 4 is that the bits themselves are too big to fit through certain devices. Like I said in the beginning, I bought the kit to repair my Steam controller (the rechargeable Amazon batteries got stuck). I thought I could fix the problem if I could unscrew the back cover. Unfortunately, the included T6 security bit was too big to even fit through the holes in the back to reach the screws. I've attached some pictures to show that the bits don't really fit the back of the Steam controller, especially if they're attached to the handle or the extension (first 4 pictures). Fortunately, it works perfectly fine for Xbox 360 controllers if you were planning on working with them (last 2 pictures).
