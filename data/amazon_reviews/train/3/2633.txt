good mic borderline great for those wanting a dynamic mic.unless you want to hear a bunch of noise (because your gian is too high) you have to have your mouth right up on this mic, within 6-8in.this has a double edge sword effect though, your voice becomes deeper, and richer, but it can give you a bit of a Jaba The Hutt sound (it doesnt slow your voice per say just super deep) so would require some live processing to clean it up.its a good mic i wont repeat what others have said but i will list two SUPER annoying cons.1. everytime you reboot your PC you must unplug and replug the USB into the mic or it wont work."Why am i using USB, it has XLR" you ask? - because it as a 3.5mm live monitoring headphone plug which leads to con #2.2. - you MUST use the USB interface for the live monitoring 2.5mm headphone plug.. WHY! you are feeding it 48v phantom power via XLR (if you are using a 48v power XLR input)i HATE that i have to do this because this 100% creates Con #1.3. For a dynamic mic it picks up a TON of surrounding noise. - yes if you move your head to the sides and back the mic fades alot, but sit at your computer in a skype or teams call with your collegues and listen to the recording later and you hear a TON of surrounding desk noise, keyboard noise, etc. you can have someone to the side snap their fingers from 4 feet away and it will pick it up. even setting the gain lower doesnt help.Make this not require the USB cable for 3.5mm usability and i will raise the score to a full on 5 Stars.
