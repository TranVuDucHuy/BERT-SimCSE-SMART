This review is for the 30ft cable. I bought it to run from my PC to my TV in the hopes of passing a 4k60 signal, preferably with HDR. Unfortunately, this cable couldn't get anywhere near that. 4k60 could not be maintained for even a few seconds, even if I switched to YUV4:2:0. I also tried compromising on 1440p, but this also could not be maintained at 60fps, HDR or not. However, if your hopes are just for 1080p, this cable does well. I could pass 1080p at 60hz with HDR and experienced no drop-outs. But ultimately, it really under-performed as a cable advertised for 4k60.Thinking I might have just gotten a dud, I ordered a replacement which shipped from a different Amazon Warehouse. This cable performed just as poorly.Ultimately, I went with a more premium cable with an active chipset (Monoprice Luxe with Spectra7's HT8181 chip), and even though it's 5ft longer (35ft), it passes 4k60+HDR with no issues. It's definitely a more expensive cable, but it actually performs as advertised.
