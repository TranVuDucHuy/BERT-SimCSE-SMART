For the price, the build quality felt solid and the headphones were comfortable and the sound quality was decent (i'm no audophile) with fairly good noise cancellation. I purchased for working from home for meetings and phone calls. When on a call, the noise cancelling feature turns off and it sounds like the headphones actually amplify ambient/background noises during the call.Ended up returning and going with the Bose 700â€™s that employ Noise Cancelation during phone calls, and allows you to connect to two devices at once. I can stream ambient noise/music from my phone and answer phone calls from my laptop. Pretty seamless. four times the cost of the Sennheiser, but in this case you get what you pay for.
