I couldn't find my old screw driver set and was sad. So I went on a replacement hunt. Saw a few reviews on this product and figured based on that and one person recommending me this set I figure why not. Product is okay for the price, the bits are good quality everything stays in place in the case and the bits are easy to pull. My driver came with some deep scratches and for a new product I was disappointed. I going to still keep the set and use but the scratches bother me. Anyways the value is not there maybe $25.00 would of been more reasonable.
