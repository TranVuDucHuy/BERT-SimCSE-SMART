Perhaps I bought into the hype, but I was not overwhelmed by these “upgraded” earbud tips for the Apple AirPods Pro. I wear them a good portion of the day for both music listening and on video conference calls over Google, Zoom, and Teams. I don’t find them any more isolating and only slightly more comfortable. Not a significant difference in sound quality, if any at all.it’s inconvenient that you are supposed to compress them before inserting the in your ears. Doesn’t sound like much until you need to do it multiple times per day.A minor upgrade, in my opinion, but not worth the price.
