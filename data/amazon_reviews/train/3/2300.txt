This is an update:I was having trouble keeping my Airpod Pros in my ears, especially my left.Best fit with Apple earpieces was with Medium in right ear, and Small in Left.Medium in Left ear fell out all the time, Small would stay in "somewhat longer".With these foam tips, Medium in both ears, left ear still works its way out eventually.Small in left ear was worse.Overall, they stay in better.So...these DO help the Airpods stay in my ear better, not perfectly.The left will always come loose eventually, but it's not a deal breaker, it's better than before.The BIG trade-off is that you loose the Noise Cancellation, there is no difference between on and off.Transparency Mode seems to be better, as normal ambient noise reduction is less with foam plugs.Doing the Apple Fit Testing function with these, there was never a combination that was "acceptable".Guessing that is due to the lack of "seal" that creates the Noise Cancellation.For me, as a person with hearing loss, better transparency is worth more then Noise Cancellation.So I am satisfied with these for the time being.I will probably, in the future look for something better, rubber rather than foam.Like a tip that goes further into the ear canal.Or I hope Apple with improve the in-ear fit, with the device itself going further into the ear canal.But I'm not holding my breath.I'm not really saying there is anything terribly wrong with these foam plugs.I have trouble with my ears and any in-ear headset products.They could be just fine for you.I have a friend that rides his motorcycle with his Airpods in.Mine would be long gone.
