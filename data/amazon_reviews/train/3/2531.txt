in general I've been wanting a speaker replacement and this fits my needs for now. it came fast and for 33 dollars, its really decent with good battery life and on top of that, it has USB-c to charge it up which is great to charge if you're on a rush or on the go. the sound, it sounds great with a bit of EQing, but if you arent EQ'ing, the treble is more present than the bass but generally the bass, it's still audible , but my guess for the treble being louder has to do with the speaker being loud enough in a outside setting which is a win, but overall it sounds good, but it can sound a bit better with a 3rd party eq app (sorry apple users, EQing in this format wont work for yall so disgreard EQing as a whole). the speaker can handle about 5 db of extra bass without it sounding distorted at around 310 Hertz. once it does I turn on a limiter and it sacrifices a bit of loudness but thankfully through bluetooth it gives me a lot of headroom for volume loudness, so at the end of it I'm not sacrificing loudness with EQing. Aux wont work the same unless theres a powerful dac involved to increase loudness. now to talk about a dent on this product, not only it came in 2 boxes, it somehow has a dent? not sure if this is meant to show where the charging port is but everyone should know how a usb c port looks like. 4/5
