Well, I bought 2 of these to straighten out my corner computer desk. So many cords I couldn't clean up or trace a line and way too many power strips. I'm glad I got two because you cannot put two transformer type plugs beside each other. The spacing of the plugs is too close. Unless you are using some of the small ones the best you can do is put one on the bottom of each upright, so 4 total. If you try to put one on the top, the on/off switch for that bank is in the way and you will turn it off. You can try to use it by not pushing the blades all the way in but if it's a big one they can fall out or you take a chance of turning that bank off. If you are only using a standard plug it works very well. I won't be using the night light but I did try them and they work quite well.Here are some dimensions to consider. The plugs are 1 -11/16 inches apart or center to center. The plug strip itself is 4 - 5/8 inches long. That is from the bottom edge of the power switch at the top to the beginning of the flare at the base. This product does not take care of the problem of the large transformer plugs. If they added another inch or two to the height, I think the problem would have been solved. Maybe they were worried about balance since the way it works now puts all the weight down low. One other thing to remember is how are the plug blades positioned. On some of mine they are parallel to the plug strip which means one plug takes up that whole side. I was somewhat prepared for that and keep them in a power strip. All of this was connected to a UPS and I had another plug available on it.Overall for the price they're OK. Since I have two I can make it work for me and I will be keeping them. If you are looking for something to load up with big plugs, this ain't it. A few big plugs, some USB chargers and regular plugs, it should work just fine for you.
