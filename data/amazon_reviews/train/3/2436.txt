The first issue: I bought the product as a new, but when I received it, it didn't have the carry bag or the instructions.Quality: The headphones focus heavy on the mid-range, in my opinion. It kind of buries the vocals. Also, if you like a lot of bass, I wouldn't recommend these headphones. I had to adjust the eq on my phone to accommodate for the buried vocal and little bass.
