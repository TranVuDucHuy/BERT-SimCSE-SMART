The cable does everything it's suppose to expect keep a tight connection on the Micro-B end. I purchased this 6ft cable to replace the 1.5ft cable that came with my USB 3.0 4-port hub. The hubs existing cord seemed to have a little bit of a loose connection, I was hoping this cable would connect tighter, but it seems just as loose, if not more loose. Experience with USB 2.0 Micro-B cables is that many off brand cables develop a loose connection, while the high end cables keep a tight connection. Since this USB hub is the only device I have that uses the USB 3.0 Micro-B I couldn't test to determine if the port could be at fault, but based on many other reviews, and my past experience I'd say the cable is at fault.I was able to use some zip ties to tightly strap the Micro-B end to the hub which makes it work perfectly for my needs
