I saw this on cyber Monday and thought it was a great deal. The light is easy to use and assemble. The brightness is great too. The only reason why I didn't give it a five star review is because my USB cable started to fray almost immediately. This small thing is very frustrating in the long wrong because who knows how long this light will work now. There isn't even a way to replace the wire so once it goes I have to replace my whole ring light.
