I bought this a couple months ago, and the printer said the ink was OUT today. I unwrapped the new cartridge, inserted it, and the printer keeps saying it is empty.*A couple days later, I received my color cartridges. THEN the black ink worked. What is that even about? I was printing as black and white, so the printer is ridiculous for not printing unless I also changed out the yellow.
