Items in box had been repackaged before shipment. The box clearly had been opened before I received it. Although the cartridges worked in my new printer, it makes one wonder if returned items are being hastily shoved in boxes and sold as new. Also received a set of color, LCS203, Brother cartridges and they had been opened as well, with one of the cartridges being the wrong type and would not work, causing me to have to return for replacement.
