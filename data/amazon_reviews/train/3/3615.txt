Iâ€™m not too keen about this purchase. The cord is a little too short. My biggest problem is that the plugs would not stay in the outlets tightly. It seems like one of my top outlet is not working. The buttons are in an weird position. Every time I want to plug out something I end up turning off a switch. The night light get on my nerves. I also thought it was taller. I will not purchase this again.
