Over the course of 19 months (since I had initially replaced the OEM packs), I had done very little printing. One would think that these XL ink packs would last much longer, but they didn't. The most apparent reason why they only lasted 19 months is because the printer -- J4420DW -- is constantly cleaning the heads. This is not so much of an issue if you frequently print things out, but if you rarely use your printer, you'll be left wondering what happened to all that ink. It wasn't ~550 pages; it was more like 50 pages at most.While the color and quality are excellent, it falls far short in terms of value.
