I bought these to use at work, they seem to be very comfortable without other style earbuds, that have problems staying in and ear pain, the sound quality is somewhat mediocre, with a booster aap they do become louder but they emanate a crackling sound, the soundcore life P3 mini's didn't do that which are much cheaper so I said screw it and got a really good price on brand new Sony wf 1000 xm4's.
