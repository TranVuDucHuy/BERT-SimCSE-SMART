I just installed it on my 2019 Samsung 65" tv. The stand appears to be well made. One person can assemble it, but it is easier with two people. They give you packages that are well marked for each part that you will need. When you mount the holding brackets to the back of the tv is where you run into a problem. The spacers they give you are just a hair wider then the access holes to the internal nut in the tv. So when you do find the proper spacers and tighten down on the bolt, the spacers actually go inside the hole. You need to put a washer under each of these spacers, which is not supplied nor is it even indicated that you will need to do this. Also Once I picked the spacers that kept the mounting brackets level on the back tv. I noticed then when mounted to the stand ,the tv was tilted backwards. I needed to put the larger spacer underneath the top bracket, while removing the bottom spacer all together. This made the tv stand straight. Please see photos...Also I decided to lay the tv on a bed and then mount the stand to the tv. Made it much easier then trying to pick the tv up and mount it to the stand.
