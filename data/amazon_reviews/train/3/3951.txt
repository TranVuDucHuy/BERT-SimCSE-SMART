When they are brand new, they're great. I use these for all my audio gear during gigs (example, tying cables to speaker poles). After repeated use however, they start to lose adhesion quickly. Since they're fairly inexpensive, I just replace them with new ones at that point. So if you want something heavy duty that you won't have to replace, look elsewhere.
