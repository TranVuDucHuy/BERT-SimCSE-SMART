Good sound for the money but has some quirky issues:- Micro SD card (ie "TF Card") is very finicky and sensitive on several fronts: I would write this feature off as a throw away feature- Random Bluetooth disconnects (that should not be related to battery or distance)Details:SD Card Issues:- Initially I bought a 32GB Silicon Power micro SD card off Amazon, opened it up, fresh out of the box copied some mp3 to it, shoved it in the back of the speaker, switched modes to the card and the speaker blinks for a few seconds then shuts down, did this several times same result.- Googled the issue, support claims you need to have this formatted as FAT32.- Shoved the micro SD card back in the computer, checked the format, yeah its FAT32, which just about every micro sd card would be formatted with out of the box.- Did some more Googling, I found frustrated users swearing they had a FAT32 formatted card and it was not working, met by the support department taking the attitude it was a user error, if there is an issue it must be because the user does not understand what it means to have a FAT32 formatted SD card.- Being knowledgeable in this area, I started to hypothesize that the problem maybe a little more nuanced, there are different versions of FAT32, embedded devices aren't like full blown OS'es and can't necessarily handle all the different versions.- I took a look at the partition table of the Micro SD card and the first thing I noticed was there was a small amount of leading unformatted free space before the FAT32 partition, an embedded device might get thrown off by that.- I decided to blow away the partition table and reformat the SD card.- Using Ubuntu 16.04LTS (a linux operating system) I reconstructed the partition table as an MS-DOS table, with a single FAT32 partition, no leading unformatted free space, all new FAT32 formatting.- Copied the same mp3 files back on to the freshly formatted SD card, put it in the back of the speaker, switched mode and viola music playing from the SD card!- OS maybe important here because the FAT32 format from a Linux OS can vary from the FAT32 format produced by Windows, I am not saying a Windows produced format can not work in this speaker, it might be fine or it might work with one version of Windows and not another (I am by no means testing this product to figure out what works and does not). Also it may have been that unformatted free space was throwing off the speaker, not sure. However it is definitely more nuanced then "make sure you card is formatted with FAT32"- Now with music playing off my SD card new problems arose.- First up some mp3s it would play at like half or quarter speed but most at normal speeds.- Second sometimes you hit an mp3 it refused to play and it would just shut down so you would have to delete those mp3s or re-encode them.- Which brings me to my next problem, its sensitive to mp3 encoding as well.- I eventually wrote this feature off as worthless, just decided to play mp3s off another device and Bluetooth the sound output over to the speaker.One little nicety I didn't really think about was this speaker was it has a microphone built in and Bluethooth phone controls, I actually started making a conference speaker out of this since its louder and clear then built in laptop or phone speakers/microphones. However I get random Bluetooth disconnects when I do that from time to time so it is not very reliable.It has worked out well for playing music over Bluetooth but that is it so far.
