I bought this to use with my iPhone 14 Pro Max on the bed side table. It was hard to find the perfect alignment to charge my iPhone 14 Pro Max. It works sometimes but mostly the phone will start charging and then stop at some point. It happened to me that a lot of the nights I'll put my phone to charge on this wireless charging pad and it would've stopped charging in the middle and my phone won't be fully charged in the morning. I ended up returning this and bought the Apple Magsafe charger which is perfect for apple devices.
