Apparently not a good budget ear bud. I guess they do sound better than they feel. I give them a 5 out of a BOSE 10 earbud. Fair sound... I personally just needed a semi decent set of wired earbuds to monitor my camera audio while filming weddings. The wires on these constantly tangle to the point of getting in knots that only women have the patience to fix. Probably because the wires are hair thin and the wire insulation is tacky rubber. I mean these were Frustrating to the point where they are headed to the local landfill. And for the price, not worth my time to return.
