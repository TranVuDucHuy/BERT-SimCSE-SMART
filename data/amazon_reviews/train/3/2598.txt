They're okay. The magnets aren't very strong and these aren't meant for screws that require alot of force and the screw bits sometimes fall off which can be annoying. For the price, I expected better tbh. If you're using them for pc building then they're perfectly fine, but i'd rather buy classic a screwdriver set that you can use reliably since it's a better bang for your buck. better if they're magnetized too.
