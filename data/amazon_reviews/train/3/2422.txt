I really wanted to like this product. It seems like a great idea. But...For my ribbon mic, a Shinybox MXL, it accomplished next to nothing. Or better put, it did not accomplish $200 worth of sound improvement. Still lots of signal noise and no drastic amount of gain change.Underwhelmed by its application with my gear. But take it with a grain of salt. The overwhelming opinion is that Cloudlifter products are the best thing since sliced bread.
