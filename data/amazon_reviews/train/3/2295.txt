I really like this product. Well made and high quality. But not without one major issue.When you put the EarPods in the case with the foam a bit compacted, they charge fine. But after about 10 min, the foam expands and pulls the EarPod away from the charging contacts.So whenever I want to use them, I have to open the case and hold them down with my finger for a few min to get a minimal charge.That ended up being too annoying and unreliable for me, and sadly I had to shelve these.
