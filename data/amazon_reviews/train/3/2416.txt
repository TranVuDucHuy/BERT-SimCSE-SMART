These chargers are very convenient for charging multiple types of devices. I like having one cord to charge all of my devices. But one of the cords already stopped being able to charge my iPhone. And I havenâ€™t had it for more than a few months. Also, it does charge very slowly. I am okay with that because charging the battery slowly is actually better for your phones battery life.
