Based on reviews on Amazon (saying it can handle HDR without repeater) I decided to give this cable a shot.I needed a 4K UHD/ARC/HDR/3D cable capable of transmitting over 35 f to a BenQ TK800 projector, my first option was Fiber optic cable, second option a HDMI repeater, and Third option was to look for an hdmi reliable cable capable of handling up to 18 gbps, since this was the cheaper option I decided to get this item.It worked well....... for 1 day, after that I wasn’t able to get HDR, not from the receiver or directly from my PS4 pro or even the blue ray player.However, picture quality is OK, I get all except HDR with this 35 ft cable.If you need to transmit HDR thru a longer than 25 ft cable, get a hdmi 4k repeater , (it even says it on the product description, i missed reading that part LOL)Not sure If i want to hassle with the hdmi repeater or cat6/7 boxes, I’ll give fiber optic cable a shot.Hope this review helps someone in the same situation I am.
