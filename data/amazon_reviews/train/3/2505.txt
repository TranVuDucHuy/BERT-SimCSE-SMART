Lot's of reviews, so no sense of repeating them here.Has all the travel features you need: C port for Power Delivery to a Laptop 45-65W, multi- C and B ports for personal devices. Total of 65W good for overnight charges of multiple devices. AND 2 AC ports for other devices like another Laptop (using separate charger) or appliance.BUT this charger is rated ONLY 125V, that means you can't use it outside the U.S. except for 120V countries like Japan. 125V is not stated in the description, until BaseUS emailed with that description. That is a deal killer for global travel. Otherwise, it's a Swiss Army Knife of chargers and excellent for U.S. home & travel use.
