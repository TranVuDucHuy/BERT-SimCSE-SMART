New Updated review #2 (day four):On the fourth day of just sitting, not using the speaker, it went from 100% to 90%, after fully charging.BTW. After very light use the battery was down to 70%, after fully charging (on the second day)?This unit is stereo. It doesn't take two units to have stereo.Sound testing, using a old HP (waveform) sound generator and frequency display app tool (spectrum analyzer). The highest frequency I tested to was 20kHz (that I can't hear). The lowest frequency was 60 Hz, but it was distorted and had harmonics. 100 Hz was the lowest usable frequency.BTW. I found out my almost 50 year old hearing, is now limited to 12kHz.----------------Original review:The sound is ok - Not grate. The base sound is ok - Good enough.Some advice. Peel the water proof sticker of very slowly. This will minimize the adhesive left behind. Use rubbing alcohol to remove any that is still left behind anyway.Find a charger rated for at least 2A (amps). And charge first before use.I really don't like that it doesn't shut off by its self, after 30 minutes of non use.
