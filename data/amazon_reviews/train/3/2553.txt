I bought the 2 pack, and connected them to my USB 3.Zero 3rd Party PCI board. My external "My Passport" drive was recognized and I thought it to be fine. Then I connected one of my "Pluggable" HDD connectors to the other and inserted a HDD and I've been using those fine...at least it seemed.8/3/2016I realized something is odd with the "My Password" connection. I copied all the files from the drive to another. Some read faster than others but they copied. I use Directory Opus as I don't like "Windows Exporer" at all. Once that was done, I went to reformat the drive. It was Sllloooooowwww to begin the format. I wondered what's happening. So, I deleted the partition to 320GB of a 1.86TB... I selected Format (Full), and it was sllllooowww... So I got it to where I could disconnect the HDD, then remove the Amazon cable from the connection and connected the HDD's cable directly to the USB 3.Zero PCI... Selected to do the same Format. The fiull speed happened...1% showed pretty quickly, about 1 minute and 20 seconds or so. I then stopped the format, disconnected the drive, and reconnected the Amazon USB 3.zero cable again and the HDD. Selected format again, and once again the same...well past 3 minutes to get to 1%.I used both cables with same results. I'll use it with one of my "Pluggable" devices which has an external power to see if that matters but...it shouldn't. Once I also verify all the TiVo files and MKV files are OKAY or not, I'll update this. At this moment, I will not recommend them.I like the look a lot of these cables but the functionality is now in question.
