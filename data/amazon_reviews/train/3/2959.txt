Currently using this product to mount a 55" LG G2 OLED TV.Base of stand is some kind of sturdy glass, attached to a sturdy all metal rectangular pole.However, the mounting bracket for the TVs are not VESA mounting holes, but adjustable brackets which then need to be meticulously and evenly balanced on a hook-able bar. Then this is followed up by monitoring how much the TV tilts forward.To be clear, THIS TV MOUNT DOES *NOT* MOUNT YOUR TV PERFECTLY VERTICALLY TO THE RECTANGULAR BAR. It's always tilted backwards or forwards; it is not precise at all, and there are no adjustable methods of fine-tuning tilt. You must disassemble the mount from the TV and try again with the spacers included in the box in order to hopefully get closer to a tilt you desire.This process results in something more infuriating than the TV tilting forward or backwards.. THIS TV MOUNT DOES *NOT* MOUNT YOUR TV PERFECTLY HORIZONTAL. There is no guide or help in the design to perfectly hang the brackets on the bar; you are almost guaranteed to mis-align the TV and result in a crooked mount.I don't believe in a bad product, only in a bad price. And for the price, this is a fine product. However I do wish I splurged more and gotten an actual VESA mounting product instead of something I need to balance on a bar / hook system.If I didn't notice the crooked TV position, this product would look great. It's glass and metal, and the TV blocks the stupid looking multi bracket hook bar system behind it.
