I bought 3 of these for my kids Amazon Fire tablets and not one of them worked. It was irritating when we were on our way in a car for a 20 hour drive and no entertainment. Unfortunately, since my kids rarely use technology, I didn't know it didn't work until too late. I'm sure they'll work in other devices. At least I hope.
