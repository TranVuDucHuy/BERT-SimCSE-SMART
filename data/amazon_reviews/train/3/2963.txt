Base was fairly easy to assemble, and no other tools were needed besides whatever came in the package. It does not look fancy at all, but it is a pretty simple TV stand, and hopefully it will live up to it's promise of holding nearly 88 lbs, and TVs up to 65". We intended to use this base with our 55" Insignia set, mostly so we could be able to swivel it while watching TV in the living room, but we ended up using it to hold a 37" old Philips/Magnavox flat screen TV in our bedroom; we were better off lifting up the TV for better view from bed, than needing to swivel the one in the living room; the trade paid off. However, it let us try the base with a lighter set, and truth be told, I might be a bit worried having it hold the 55" heavier set, although it is supposed to, we'll see. The higher up you position your TV, the more of the metal post you'll get to see, and the more the stand would jiggle, so be cautious. Thankfully no kids or pets in our home to worry from tipping it over. Fortunately the black metal post gets lost under poor lighting, so no eye sore there. The swivel option is pretty handy, and most important reason for me to have purchased it, even though might not end up using it soon. Since stand does not come with any cable-hiding options, some tie wrap mounts will come handy to route the cables down the back, thankfully I only needed to hide two cables (power & hdmi), so I'm good. Overall I'm satisfy, since I was able to lift the TV, and once you get used to it, the stand will stop being an eye-sore. If I overcome my doubt that the stand can hold a bigger set, I will go ahead and purchase an additional one to use its swiveling option in my living room, we'll see. Good Luck.
