I returned this one because found a better deal in other store.This one was depleting battery like crazy, 20% in 4 days.Other SmartTag+ works perfectly. Using it to track my cat. Cat looks very proud to have a personal pager :)Maximum distance was only 60 meters. Typical detection distance is 8 - 15 meters.Very useful but overpriced.
