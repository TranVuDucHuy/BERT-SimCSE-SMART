I ordered the long cord listed as "GE 6 Outlet Surge Protector". What I got was "Jasco" brand and "using the GE name by license". That is NOT a GE product; that is false advertising. "Trusted Brand â€“ GE is the #1 Brand in surge protection and extension cords" yeah, maybe, but since I got a JASCO surge protector I don't see how that helps. And yes, I'm aware sometimes companies have products made for them, but I expect GE to be the people warranting the stuff I buy FROM GE not some third party company I've never heard of. ESPECIALLY looking at all the reviews of people who had overheating/house issues. Don't sell it as GE if it's JASCO!Edit: I googled it (kind of annoyed I had to spend ten minutes doing this in order to avoid sending back a $20 thing) and Jasco's website says they make a lot of "GE" products. Still pretty sketchy to sell it as "GE" but it didn't burn the house down with one printer plugged in overnight so yay, bumping the stars up. Still pretty annoyed. It's not like buying a store brand and you know you're probably getting something made by Nabisco, it's like buying Nabisco and getting the store brand -- probably the same thing but there's a reason it's not sold under the brand name.
