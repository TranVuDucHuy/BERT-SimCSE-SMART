I tried these Anker earbuds to see how they compare with my Wyze Buds Pro. The Anker Life P3 are decent but not as good. There are a couple things that make the Wyze Buds Pro better. One of the big things is that Wyze will let you use transparency or noise canceling with one earbud versus the Anker will not. Another thing and this is maybe personal preference but with the Wyze they have automatic equalizer that adjust based on what your listening and it works very well. The Anker you can choose between preset EQ or set your own EQ which some may prefer but I personally like the automatic EQ of the Wyze better because I don't have to mess around with the app and everything just sounds amazing automatically. The other thing is the Wyze Buds Pro have a wear sensor that automatically pause what you're listening to and resume when you put them back in. I didn't think it was a big deal at first until I didn't have it. Noise cancellation is also much better with the Wyze, Anker is pretty weak with noise cancellation in my experience. Overall the Anker earbuds are okay, but you can often find the Wyze Buds Pro on sale for the same or less than the Ankers and they have quite a bit more features.
