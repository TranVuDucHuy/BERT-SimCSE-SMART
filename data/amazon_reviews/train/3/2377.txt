When I use it for my videos of myself, it’s fine. I like that you can adjust the color and bright Ed’s of the light to suit your needs. But recording or photographing products… no good. It’s super top/heavy, so I don’t know how many times, even with piles of books weighting the base, the camera has toppled over. When the light is on the product, it creates a halo shadow around it rather than uniform light distribution. Additionally, it is difficult to keep the stand out of the video without work arounds.
