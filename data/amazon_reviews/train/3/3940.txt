I have this running from my desktop to my tv and it works fine for what I use, 1080p gaming. But during testing I tried switching to a higher frame rate and resolution and unfortunately it just can't handle it. The picture will cut off and stop working, and/or the audio will start cutting in and out. I'm gonna keep using mine as like I said it works fine for me but if you're buying this expecting perfect 4k quality you will be disappointed, and it's shady that they would advertise it as such.
