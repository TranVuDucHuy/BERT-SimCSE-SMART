I think these are a fantastic upgrade. They are comfortable, fit fantastically and really make them feel secure in my ears. The biggest downside I can tell so far is that I have had them for a month and already im seeing wear on them. I imagine within the next 60-90 days these tips will be completely worn out and will need replacing. At the current price of $24.99, I couldn't recommend them based on their durability alone.
