I had my first DOSS soundbox for three years. I loved it. Great sound. Then it promptly went haywire; it would turn on and off by itself 24/7. It was ridiculous. I would have to stuff it in the garage at night because it would keep me up. I gave up trying to fix it and threw it in my dumpster outside and could still hear it going on and off and beeping etc. I read some similar reviews of this happening to others so decided to try a different brand. I had an Anker for two months and wasn’t impressed with the sound quality and then it ALSO went nuts turning off and on constantly and it wouldn’t hold a charge. Seriously?! I live in a single family home well out of range of any neighbor’s Bluetooth devices. I scoured my house for any phone or tablet or computer that could try to be connecting to the speaker and none of them had Bluetooth on…there is no explanation other than 1) I coincidentally ended up with two defective speakers from different companies, 2) aliens or 3) some creepy person or device is somehow trying to hack into my Bluetooth speakers. I figured it was the first. So I returned the Anker and decided I’d try another DOSS. My parents have had their DOSS for over 4 years and haven’t had any issues, so I’m hoping this one lasts longer and I don’t experience any more weirdness.
