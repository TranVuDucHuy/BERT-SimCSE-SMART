I'm taking 2 stars off what I think is otherwise a nicely put together precision kit. The reason being the bit guide is imprinted in the black foam. You can barely make out what each bit's label is with great light and a magnifier.They put a lot of work into the packaging and their self-promoting sticker sheet, but they missed a bit usability problem with the actual product.Engraved black foam labels. Really.
