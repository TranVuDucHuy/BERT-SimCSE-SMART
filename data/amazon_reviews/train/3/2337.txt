Soooo I've had this stand since November, and up until recently it was great. The light is bright, there are a lot of color and brightness options, and the thing is pretty sturdy and pretty tall. However, today I was adjusting the stand and the ring light popped off and fell on the floor. Like, it just popped right off. Thank goodness my phone wasn't in it. It looks like maybe the screw part was just glued on, and the glue gave out under the weight of the light? So yea, be careful with the pole that attaches to the ring light. It's very flimsy under the weight of the light, and it might just pop off. Maybe detach the ring light when you aren't using it, so it doesn't put stress on the very thin pole.
