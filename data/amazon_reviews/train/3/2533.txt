Speaker works great, the sound is clear, BT connectivity is good and volume levels can be adjusted to my liking. However, using the volume adjuster on the speaker doesn't always work as you need a specific circular motion that is difficult to do correctly. In addition, there is no good option to skip or disconnect incoming calls. I have my speaker connected to my phones for playing music but when a call comes in there isn't a good way of answering the call on my phone without it going through the speaker and I end up having to shut it off whenever a call comes in
