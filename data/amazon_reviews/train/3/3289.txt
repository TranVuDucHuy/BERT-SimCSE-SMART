Putting a mutlicharging cable on a spool for easy packing and space savings is a great idea. But at least with this product, it doesn't work.1. The spool is large, and the cable has to stick out from both ends so you are dealing with something that will eat at a minimum of four inches of length and an inch of depth. And that assumes you fold over the cable that sticks out from the spool, which kind of defeats the purpose2. The spool doesn't work very well and getting the cable to rewind sometimes takes some doingI'd advise just getting a high-quality regular multi-cable (I love these, for example, https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PYDT59Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and maybe a cable tie (or rubber band). It will take less space and be far less annoying.
