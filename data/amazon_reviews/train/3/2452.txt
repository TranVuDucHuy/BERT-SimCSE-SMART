TL;DR REVIEW: Be warned. I've missed calls, texts, and alarms because of this adapter. Don't sleep with it plugged in if you want to get any notifications/alarms/calls.LONGER REVIEW: The product let's me charge my 2022 iphone SE while using my aux cord headphones, however I've noticed when I'm using the Belkin adapter my ringer and notification sounds no longer work. I'll have my headphones in and I'll see I'm getting a call but it's silent. I've double checked silent mode etc on my phone and did tests with the Belkin adapter plugged in while asking people to call and text me and I've come to find this adapter is the issue.I've missed calls/texts/alarms when I've left this adapter plugged in. It sucks to know if I'm using it I may miss something, so proceed with the caution. I'm gonna look into a different adapter that doesn't have this issue.
