I bought these mainly because I wanted a way to hide my apple charging cables by using the magnets to hold them up on the back of the iMac screen the way it's shown in their product photos but sadly they do not hold whatsoever to the back of my iMac. They do magnetize to the edge of the screen but not anywhere on the back of the display screen so to hide the cables
