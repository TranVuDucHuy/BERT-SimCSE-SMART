After reading so many stellar reviews I was eager to get my hands on this and hear the difference for myself. For my use case however, it just didn't make an appreciable enough difference to warrant holding on to. I use an RE20 into a MBOX2 Mini that I have to run pretty hot to achieve good levels. I thought adding in the Cloudlifter would help me lower my noise floor and unlock some magical tone from the increased headroom. It just wasn't the case for me.As others have said, it's solidly built and just as simple as can be. For the price it would be nice if they threw in a short patch cable.
