Update-Replacment cable worked as it should allowing external drive to connect via USB 3.0. still only giving 3 stars as either the quality control is absolutely horrible or the 1st broken cable I received was used & broken by someone. Either way not good.Extra row of USB 3.0 pins bent & broken out of the box. Amazon is sending replacement hassle free. Without having to return the broken item. If the replacement works as it should I'll update my review. Horribly inconvenience receiving broken cable to replace broken cable as I'm still not able to use my external hard drive that I need this cable for. Wish I could be reimbursed for my wasted time, energy, and extra device down time.
