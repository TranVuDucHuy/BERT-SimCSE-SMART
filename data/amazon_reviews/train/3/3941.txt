I got this to run from my Denon X3700H receiver to my Epson 5050UB Projector. It works well for my Panasonic 4K UHD Player and most of the time with my Firestick 4K devices passing 4K HDR material with no problem. It fails trying to pass 4K material from my Dish Joey 4K box for some reason. I tried a short cable as an experiment and the Dish 4K channel showed up fine. I partially blame this on the crappy Dish Joey box. It is junk, but the cable is likely also at fault. Iâ€™ll try a different cable and see if I get better results.
