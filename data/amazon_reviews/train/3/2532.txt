I use this to make up for a weak audio circuit in my laptop. It connects readily and automatically via Bluetooth, and automatically shuts off to save battery life if you, for example, set the laptop aside for a while, or stop watching YouTube or whatever. My chief complaint is with the sound quality - it's really muddy. Very low amplitude in the spoken word frequencies, and not "crisp" - it sounds like a cheap speaker enclosed in a cardboard box, where the sides of the box are resonating. There are no controls - bass/treble - to allow you to tailor the frequency response curve, so you're stuck with a very narrow and marginal quality frequency response, reflective of a very cheap speaker. The loudness is very good - you can turn it up to a very high level. The battery life is good - you rarely have to charge it via the USB-C connector. In all, would not buy again for use as a supplementary speaker for either music or the spoken word. It really needs a "treble" boost capability.
