I am no fan of dongles for cell phone use. I purchased this audio + charger for my Iphone 8. I read some complaints about these adapters failing to charge or pass audio signal to the speaker. Sometimes intermittent failure of either one feature or both. As I said before, I am no fan of dongles. When those cheap dongles were boxed with Iphones, I had issues with the dongle distorting my listening experience through my head phones. So I added heat shrink tubing to the dongle to keep it from flexing. My listening experience improved after the modification. So, I have added two layers of heat shrink tubing to this audio + charger adapter to keep the intermittent problems from occurring. So far, this modification has kept me from experiencing the problems others have had with this over priced device and those silly Apple headphone dongles.Make sure to use a heat gun on low heat. Keep the dongle just close enough to the heat gun to shrink the tubing.Another possible option to try is using self fusing silicone tape. Wrap that baby with it until the cable can not be flexed. This option wont look as nice, but you wont risk melting your over priced dongle.
