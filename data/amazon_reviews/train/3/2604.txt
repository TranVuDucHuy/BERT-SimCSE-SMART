I bought this so I didn't have to keep disconnecting one printer to switch to another. It didn't work well splitting my two printers - a Dymo Label Writer and an Arkscan. I often had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to print. It was still a pain and wasn't the easy fix I was hoping for.After about a month of use, I started getting the tone every time I got up from my chair - I thought someone was spying on me or recording how much time I spent at my laptop. I didn't realize what the sound was until I did a quick search on the internet and came across a forum that discussed the exact same thing happening to someone else...the sound I was hearing was that of something being plugged/unplugged from the USB port. It only happened when I stood up. I unplugged it and it stopped.I thought maybe I could use it on a different USB port (on the opposite side of my laptop) with a small lamp and a USB extender but after just a few hours, my file folder opened up like I wanted to save a document. At the moment I wasn't even using my laptop. I closed it and continued working and a few minutes later it opened again. I knew it was the splitter so I removed, my file folder did not reopen, and will no longer be using this product. I will spend a little more money and get something that works.
