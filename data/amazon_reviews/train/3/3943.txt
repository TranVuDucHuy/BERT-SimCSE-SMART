I bought this cable to connect my Sony XBR65X810c to my High-end gaming PC that sits on the other side of the living room. My PC has the Nvidia 900 series GPU(s) which supports HDMI 2.0 (high-speed HDMI), and my TV also has an enhanced HDMI signal mode that allows it to display 4K content at 4:4:4 chroma through HDMI input.If you do not have a TV that supports 4:4:4 Chroma at 4K resolution, then this cable would work just fine for you, but if you're in the same situation as i was, then i'll advice you to go for the PlugLug High-Speed HDMI Cable Version 2.0 (you can find it here on amazon)Below are the results of my testing:4K Full RGB 4:4:4 chroma 60Hz = No input (or sometimes input with green dots all over the screen)4K Full RGB 4:4:4 chroma 30Hz = Works4K 4:2:2 60Hz 8 or 12bpc = No input (or sometimes input with white dots all over the screen)4K 4:2:2 30Hz 8 or 12bpc = Works4K 4:2:0 60Hz 8 or 12bpc = Works4K 4:2:0 30Hz 8 or 12bpc = WorksThis review is based on the 20feet version of this cable ONLY. The shorter versions of the cable would possibly work just fine on all settings.
