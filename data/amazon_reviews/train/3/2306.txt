This does what it’s suppose to do but not as well as it should for the pricing. This is a cheap plastic box that probably costs pennies to make and should be sold at the dollar store. The plastic is thin, the latch tabs don’t work properly and if you’re planning on opening and closing it on a regular basis then expect to have to replace it quickly. In all honesty this should be 1/4th the price and the profit margin would still be astronomical.
