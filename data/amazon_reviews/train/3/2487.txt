This charger (M-100mm model, 5.3 mm thickness) is so thin that if you put your phone on it parallel to its power cable (see photo), then your phone is not going to rest fully on the surface of the charging pad but form a bridge between the power cable and the opposite edge of the charging pad (see photos). The thinnest USB-C plug I've found is 6.5 mm thick, so the gap can be as little as 0.6 mm and Your phone will be close enough to charge OK, but over time the phone will show signs of wear as the pad rubs it at the two small points of contact.To avoid that you can put your phone on the pad at 90 degrees to the pad's power cable (see photo), but then your phone will entirely block the pad's indicator lights and you won't get visual confirmation that your phone is charging or an indication of when the phone is charged.This doesn't make the pad entirely useless, it just makes its indicator lights mostly useless, and you can place your phone at an awkward angle to see part of the indicator light. Not a problem if you don't care much about the design of the everyday things in your life, but if you value good design this could be an issue for you. An issue which could have been entirely avoided by having the indicator lights at 90 degrees from where they are now, or by having 4 indicator lights at 90 degrees from each other instead of 2 lights at 180 degrees as in the current design. A missed opportunity.
