I liked this product a lot when I first got it. Until now. When I have my phone plugged in it goes charging to not charging back and forth. It does it also on my iPad. Both items use different cords. So I know it’s not my phone, because it happens with my iPad too. It’s not the cable because I’ve tried different cables. It’s the PowerCharger. I can’t find any information about a warranty.
