This is a decent charging brick, works like a short extension cord + USB outputs. Appreciate the fact that it came with a cable since it's one less thing to buy. My testing on an Elitebook 745 G6 revealed the USB C ports can in fact charge a low-to-mid end laptop without a problem, and having one brick to handle multiple items is nice for traveling (someone actually just gave me an aftermarket Switch dock, and this brick is the only adapter that I have that will work with it, so great timing on my end!)However, please be aware that the title of this listing is misleading. Reading the notes on the brick itself, the *COMBINED* output of the two USB C ports *when used simultaneously is 45 watts + 20 watts, for a total of 65 watts.In short, *this is NOT A 65 WATT CHARGER*, and any device that requires a 65 watt charger will NOT receive the expected power the title of this listing claims it will push. USB C Port 1 can push up to 45 watts of power, which is fine for smaller laptops. However, laptops with higher power requirements won't charge quickly/at all due to only 45 watts being pushed -- this is especially true for the laptops that require a 100 watt charger.This is decent for traveling especially in a car where you might only have one power outlet, or if you want to toss a one-size-fits-all charger in your bag, but in all honesty for the price I purchased at there are better items on the market. In good faith, I can't recommend this item.
