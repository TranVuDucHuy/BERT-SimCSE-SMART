Bought this kit to try out since it has some bits not covered in my other sets. The handle is good. Aluminum body, comfortable, and the head spins like it's on a bearing (I suspect it might actually be on one). I'd say it was great, but I had to glue the magnet back in after removing the third bit I put in it. Also the bits fit a bit loose compared to other 4mm handles I own (Wiha 280 and 281p , Wera 051485).The kit includes an impressive assortment of bits, including several hard to find styles and sizes, including JIS 000, small etorx, and a Torx T2. The bit quality itself is OK. Machining is not as good as my Wiha bits, but for the price that's to be expected. The ones I've tried out so far have worked fine. My biggest complaint with the bits is that they are chromed. At first this would seem like a plus, as it prevents rust and corrosion. However there are two problems with chrome on screwdriver bits. First, the bits are usually made by an OEM (let's not kid ourselves, iFixit, like many tool companies, doesn't actually manufacture their tools, they contract OEMs to do that) who is probably making chromed and bare metal versions. That means the chromed bits were probably not sized to account for the chrome. Now on a Phillips #2, no big deal. But on a Philips 00 or a T3, that can start to affect the fit. The second issue is that thin chrome finishes flakes, and bits, particularly those made from softer steel, flex, which can make the flaking worse. Looking at the case under a light, I can already see tiny flecks of chrome on the black foam insert. Chrome flakes are something I'd prefer to keep away from delicate electronics, especially those with small pin pitch chip packages and tiny, tightly packed SMD components.For general use, it's a good set overall for the price. I suspect heavily used bits will need to be warrantied out more often than some may expect however. And the product does have a lifetime warranty.
