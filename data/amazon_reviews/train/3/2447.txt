I think that the F8J212 is not fully compatible with the iPhone 13 Pro. It works for a while, but after a few minutes, the problems listed below randomly occur. Belkin customer support tells me that all versions of the iPhone 13 are compatible with the F8J212. I think they need to revisit that. I had the same problems with the 2 replacement F8J212's that Belkin sent me as I did with the 2 that I originally purchased from Amazon.I replaced the charging cable and earbuds with good quality new ones and the charger with a new 12W USB-C PD type, even though that shouldn't have been necessary, just to eliminate them as the problem - still had the same problems.Note that I tried the F8J212's with an iPhone XR and same charger, charging cable, and earbuds, and they worked flawlessly, which is why I think it's a compatibility issue with iPhone 13 Pro. This iPhone 13 Pro was purchased brand new directly from Apple about 2 months ago and works perfectly otherwise, so I feel certain it's not a problem with the phone itself.The problems:(1) Occasionally the phone will start repeatedly sounding the power reconnect tone every couple of seconds. With the charging cable plugged directly into the phone without the F8J212, the power reconnect tones never occur except when the cable is initially plugged in.(2) When wearing the earbuds and not playing any sound, it will sometimes start making a soft click noise every few seconds. I believe that is the sound connection becoming intermittent.(3) When watching a video, the video will keep stopping every couple of seconds (due to sound being disconnected by the F8J212) and I keep having to hit the play button on the video - makes watching the video almost impossible.(4) Occasionally the sound will play thru the phone's speaker even though the earbuds are plugged into the F8J212 (the same earbuds work perfectly when plugged into the 3.5mm jacks of an iPhone 6s).Like other purchasers, I feel that Apple created this problem by eliminating the 3.5mm jack. I think that the bugs haven't been worked out of the Belkin adapter as far as full compatibility with the iPhone 13 Pro (again, Belkin support tells me that the F8J212 is compatible with all versions of the iPhone 13 phone - I don't believe it).
