These sound great but good lord are they annoying when you are an active person. I wear them while I work out and they consistently come loose in my ears, to which I reach up to adjust them back in and the piece recognizes it as a touch command and pauses or changes the song or starts it over. Very touchy and annoying when trying to focus and stay in the zone. Would recommend for mellow listening where youâ€™re not moving but definitely switching to something else for workouts.
