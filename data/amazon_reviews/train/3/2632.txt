I was looking for a microphone for my youtube videos. I bought this mis because it was recommended by other youtube reviewers. The biggest problem is that the recorded sound is VERY low. At the beginning I thought maybe it was because I didn't have experience with this type of mics and I tried to find the solution for a year. Nothing helped...A month ago I bought Blue Yeti X and it worked at the very beginning! I didn't need any tutorials or additional equipment for it. However the price is + $100. I had the same experience with video camera for zoom. Products around $100 are the worst. My rule is to buy cheap ( like around $25-30) or around $ 200- in between price range products don't work for their price.
