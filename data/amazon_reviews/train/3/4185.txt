I took a gamble on cheaper price due to positive reviews, but going off-brand wasn't worth it to me. These are only nice & easy when you are laminating one full paper. It's too thin & flimsy when you have lots of little things to laminate together. The brand ones I used previously created a better seal so it allowed things to stay in place better when going through the machine. The lamination is fine once you get it through the machine though.
