I think the cost is too high. $69.95 is what the price is. The big bummer is I could not find them anywhere else cheaper. But they install in seconds and work very well. I have used Brother MFC lasers for years at work and home. The other challenge is that a large capacity black toner was available but seems to no longer be available.
