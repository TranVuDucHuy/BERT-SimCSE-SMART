The Cloudlifter works as intended. No problems there. But the listing makes it look like this comes with an included xlr cable. This is frustrating since I will now have to place another order for a cable and considering there are other listings for the CL-1 that come with a bundle of cables and other accessories for the same price. I'd recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a colorless preamp - but I would direct them to another listing.
