Bought these for my wife to use while on her tablet. My wife is no audiophile but I was told the quality of the sound was "just ok" compared to her last pair from another name brand. These Panasonic Ergofit began to crackle and cut out after only 6 weeks or so of very light use (a couple weeks outside of returns). Build quality seems to be an issue with the pair I received as they didnt even last 2 months. I would not purchase these again.
