There are Pros and Cons to noise cancelling technology. They are great for reducing distracting noise in places and still be able to hear your video or music.The bad with these specific noise cancelling ear buds is there was no way to deactivate the noise cancelling; it's always ON. After wearing them for any length of time more than a few minutes resulted in discomfort in my eardrums. I would acquate it to blasting music for hours with a reduced auditory sensation and slight ringing in my ears afterwards that you would get after attending a concert.If you understand how the noise cancelling technology works, it's essentially a negative amplitude sound wave of the noise the ear buds detect, thus cancelling your perception of the noise. However, what's happening is your eardrums are being bombarded with double the amount of sound pressure. So just wearing these with no way to deactivate the noise cancelling is not only uncomfortable, it is potentially damaging to your eardrums in the long run. My older pair of noise cancelling headphones had a switch to turn them on and off, and I left them off most of the time for this very reason. I wound up replacing these with a cheap pair of non-noise cancelling ear buds and my eardrums thank me for it.
