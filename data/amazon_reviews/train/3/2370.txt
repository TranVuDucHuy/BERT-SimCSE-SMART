I ordered two 10.5 foot charging cables.One of them works very well, no problems at all, but the other “identical” cable connection to the phone is either too loose, or poorly made, as it continually disconnects and reconnects while sitting still..phone beeping all the while; sometimes it charges, sometimes not.
