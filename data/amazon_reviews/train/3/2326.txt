I order the packet of "three color ink cartridges," which was supposed to have magenta, cyan and yellow. Once you open the box, it's hard to tell which color is which (and the plastic sealing package warns not to open until you need to use it).I finally figured out that at least one way to tell is to look on the cartridge (underneath the plastic wrap). Under the main title, the subtitle shows the color of ink in it's font. Okay, so there was blue, magenta, but no yellow. I opened the package and it was black. And of course, as luck would have it, yellow is what my printer is out of and refusing to print double-sided until I reload some.A bid odd for ink that's supposed to be the real deal. I haven't had that issue with 3 party ink providers. And of course I am on deadline. :(
