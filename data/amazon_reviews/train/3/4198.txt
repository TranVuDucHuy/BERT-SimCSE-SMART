would not work with phone protector (have an old Samsung S5 that I was using basically as a music player for my daughter, the battery is pretty shot on the phone, so thought this Micro B would connect and charge it better than a regular micro... had to take the case off the phone to get it to connect and even then its not a great connection, I know it is old tech that really isnt used and the USB C is so much better than the micro and other cord connections, but had hoped the quality of this cord would be a little better, it will work, but its not that great
