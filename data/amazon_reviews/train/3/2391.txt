I really wanted to like these. The sound quality is fantastic and the price cannot be beat. However, it is missing one major feature which is multipoint connectivity. It is so annoying having to disconnect from one bluetooth device so that you can connect to another. Traveling with your iPad, laptop, and cell phone becomes hard because of this. You may be working on your laptop and get a call on your cell and have to go through this difficult process. I never thought to check that these earbuds had this feature since I thought every earbud had this feature since my 10 dollar over the neck earbuds had them. Bummer...
