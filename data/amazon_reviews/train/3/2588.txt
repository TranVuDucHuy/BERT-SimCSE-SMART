The headphones are comfortable with good sound quality. A complaint about them is that the wires come undone and exposed. It happened to two pairs after a couple of months, and I figured it was just a glitch. But then the other pairs have also all done the same and Iâ€™ve only had them since September. They are for classroom use and that obviously is not safe so needless to say I was disappointed to have this happen.
