The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that is has a sticker on it that leaves a lot of glue residue after being removed and it is impossible to clean that residue off. You're left with an unsightly square of adhesive. Other than that, the speaker is pretty great! It won't win any awards for sub level bass performance, however it is pretty loud and kicks enough mid-lows to hear a good spectrum for it's size. It's very portable and from what I've read elsewhere, has a very good battery life. I just wish I could get the sticker gunk off of the front of it. That kind of ruined the first impressions of this product.
