initially I was worried if charging blocks were going to work because they got wet in the package. But so far works with cord I had. Charges phone. Only issue is it get little warm after leaving it in for an hour or so. So I will use it couple times and see if it still gets warm. Might return the product if it continues to get warm. I was disappointed with delivery of the product. Hopefully I can get replacement.
