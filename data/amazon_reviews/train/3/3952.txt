These work pretty good for wrapping up cords but I wish the magnets were a little stronger and they were a little longer. Case in point, it seems in most cases to wrap a folded cord for my wife’s hair dryer (or whatever) you have to wrap it around twice which just about stretches it to its limit in stretch ability, and not to sound petty but it’s a little bit more difficult than I’d like to match up the magnets the right way under that resistance and once you do, it leaves you hesitant if it’s gonna hold or not.They work good but just seem like they need a little bit “more”
