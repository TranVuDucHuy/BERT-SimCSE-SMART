I bought this to attach an airtag to my car keys. After 2 weeks the Apple logo was getting scratched up pretty bad. I didn't think this would be a problem so wasn't worried about that when I ordered. I have gone back and found holders like this that fully enclose the airtag to keep it from getting scratched. up. I am not returning this one because I feel like this was my fault for not realizing this would be an issue. That is not the fault of the owner of this listing, so IMO they should not have to eat the cost of return etc.
