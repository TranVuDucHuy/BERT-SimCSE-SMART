The description suggests they are capable of the 3A fast charging speed they aren't. I disconnected my other fast charging cable from the fast charging adapter and plugged this in. I only had the one device attached (Samsung note 20). Charge time went from 1 hour 7 minutes to 1 hour 27. Not terrible, but still not the fast charging they claim.And it's kind of bulky.
