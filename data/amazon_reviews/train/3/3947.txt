Out of the package, this HDMI cable is one of the most durable feeling HDMI I have bought on amazon for the price. The cable is thick, and the transition from cable to the ends feels and looks like it will last. As far as picture quality, I have zero complaints. This HDMI is a good deal, and for most people will last. However, my one complaint is that the HDMI plugs themselves seem to not be as durable as the rest of the product. Which is fine if you are able to manage the cords well to protect them from snags. However in my case, one jerk on the cord while it was plugged in was all it took to dislodge the metal plugins from the plastic housing. The metal portion stayed on the plastic, but bent a bit easier than I would like for my taste as that is what I would expect from other $5 HDMI cables. Overall this cord seems to be a quality product, but I am disappointed at how easy it was to bend the metal plugins.
