Every six months… when my AirPods die, it’s back to the wires but the materials is just meant to spilt apart, however buy an off brand and good luck not getting a screen message saying “this device is not compatible” right away… I know I can’t be the last Apple user who is mad they took the aux out off the iPhones….Also not everyone has aux in, or usb in their cars…
