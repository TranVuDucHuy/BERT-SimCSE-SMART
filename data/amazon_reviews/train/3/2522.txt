I’ve hardly ever written a review like this but while this seemed solid out of the box, one of the gray sliding outlet covers popped out of its track when I swapped a plug out for a different position. Then turning it off for the first time, my desk light flickered as I flipped the switch. Maybe it will hold up but I’m skeptical. Not going to return it since it’s under my desk and it would be a hassle to go back under and disconnect everything. Not my usual experience with Amazon Basics.
