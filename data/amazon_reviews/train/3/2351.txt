I was stupid to think that we could rotate the sockets to better fit plugs, but no, it is only to close it (as the name obviously state: "Twist-to-close"). Quite useless in my opinion :)Pros:- It works: you plug in your electric device and the electricity goes to your device. Works for multiple devices at the same time.- Cord is not so longCons:- Cord is not very long- Sockets are too close to each other, some plugs (like a Nintendo Switch charger) are too large and get the space of 2-3 sockets.- Holes are a bit shallow, some plugs do not go all the way in (like the one from my PC cord)
