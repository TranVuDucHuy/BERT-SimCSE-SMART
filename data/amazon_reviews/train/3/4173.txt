**TL/DR BELOW****UPDATED REVIEW BELOW**I just have to say WOW, I had to spread the word on these guys. I am super impressed with these earbuds. If you told me that I could have a pair of earbuds that sounded great, did not distort any sound, were comfortable, looked decent, and they were only 8 dollars, I WOULD SLAP YOU AND CALL YOU A LIAR!! I would be severely mistaken however (and arrested), as I am dead wrong.I had read reviews on a couple of different websites that these were the El Dorado of earbuds under 50 dollars. Some were so brave as to exclaim that these were the best earbuds under 100 dollars. I then found 33,000 reviews on Amazon with the overwhelming majority saying that these are THE best cheap earbud to get. These brash claims caught my attention, and as a gadget guru and headphone enthusiast, I had no choice but to succumb to the lavish price of 8 dollars.For those interested in a breakdown: these come with three sets of eartips, which I had to play with because I could not find the right size at first. Making sure you have the right size ear tips in is CRUCIAL, because it will form a seal around your ear and you will be able to isolate and block external noise better, hear the music louder and clearer, and the bass will be more prominent. I have had these for a week so far and have used them for a multitude of things.I’ve watched movies, listened to music while mowing the lawn (these were sufficient at for drowning out most noise), worked out with them, and used them for playing games. The best things I would recommend them for are for just casually listening to music and watching movies. This is my general test on how good headphones are: Play Rage Against the Machine and see if I can get pumped up on the bass, then play I Saw Her Standing There by The Beatles and see if I can hear George Harrison twanging away on his guitar over Paul McCartney’s overpowering bass. These definitely beat a lot of over the ear headphones that I own. The sound is balanced and I could hear everything almost exactly like the original audio recording. They also had a reasonable audio level and got as loud as I needed them before I hit the highest setting.I would not recommend these for working out, as they just kept falling out of my ears and distracting me while I was running.I also would say that these are not an acceptable headphone for FPS or multiplayer gaming, as you really need an over the ear set to amp up all the noise in the game and help give you directional listening. I could not pinpoint footsteps / etc. with these earbuds as well as with my Audio Technica and Polk Headsets. Also, you need a decent mic for voice chat and this model does not have a mic. Generally though, these are worth it for everything else mentioned.So, here I am. Telling you to get these. Get them now. Don’t hesitate.**TL/DR: 8 Dollar headphones, why you not buy?****PRODUCT UPDATE 08/14/16** 5 stars dropped to 3What am I doing up at 1247am on a Sunday? One may answer that I am at a club having a great time, or watching a movie with my fiance, or having a sleepover with my family, but the answer to that question is none of the above. I am awake at this hour as your sworn headphone avenger, to tell you not to buy these headphones. You should buy these headphones instead:
