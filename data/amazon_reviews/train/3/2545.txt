I just bought an external CD/DVD drive for a new desktop PC, and I needed a USB connector cable so I could actually place the drive onto my desk and not have to lean over to see what I was doing. For some strange reason I could not find any vendor that offered one that was a bit longer than 6 inches but not several feet long, so now I have a lot of stiff cable that I have to keep out of the way and seems like total overkill. I do understand that there are plenty of situations that call for a long cable, but this is not one of them. This works well as a connector, though - Windows recognizes it, and it does not seem like it is flimsy.
