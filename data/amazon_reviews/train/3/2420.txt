Out of the box, the cloudlifter doesn't come with the extra XLR cable you'd need to make up for it stepping in between your mic and your interface, which is annoying enough to set someone back if they happened not to mentally make note of the omission before buying. The product would benefit a lot from having a short XLR cable included since I imagine most users would already have the cabling they want already in place. (I'm not an audio expert; my opinion's worth about as much salt as I ate today, which is to say, not much.)
