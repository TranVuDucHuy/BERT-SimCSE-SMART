I bought this mostly in hopes to light and film my artwork - which I believe it was advertised for at some point. It is not good for that. I don't know why they decided to have only about 4 inches of that weird flexible stand for camera, but that never stays steady. It's nearly impossible to set the camera up in a way that doesn't show part of the stand. The stand does not stay stable unless you use the camera on the opposite side of stand. The sides that hold the phone also perfectly cover buttons you don't want them to press on for optimal camera placement.All that said it's probably fine if you want to use it for lighting your face during calls and things like that.
