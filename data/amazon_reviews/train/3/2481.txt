Received this product on 4 May 22. Setup was very easy. The device battery status read fully charged. I connected to the tag this afternoon 7 May and the battery status read half charge. Reading on the Samsung site, the battery should last nearly a year. It's been 3 days and burned 1/2 the battery. I've only connected to the tag a few times. The tag works great and the app is easy to use the only problem is the battery life.Update No. 1 - 14 May 22 received low battery notification time to replace. I replaced the battery, fingers cross this on last more than 10 days.Update No. 2 - 10 Jun 22 just received low battery notification time to replace. The brand new replacement battery lasted a whopping 27 days.Update No. 3 - 12 Jun 22, I opened the tag and noticed that the battery wasn't seated in place. I took the battery out, pushed the button and waited 10 minutes prior to reinstalling the same battery. I made sure the battery was completely seated in position and put the back on. I checked the battery status in the smart thing app, status full green, only 2% used. I found the battery hard to seat properly. It didn't want to fully click in place. Hopefully, this was the reason for the battery life problem.
