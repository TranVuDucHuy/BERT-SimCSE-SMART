PROS: The cord is nice and thick and well made. The plug strip is sturdy and easy to use. CONS: While using this plug strip to run a carpet cleaner there was a surge that blew out the breaker, but the circuit breaker on the plug strip did not trip. This means it did not do the job of being a surge protector. Fluke? Unsure. I've never had this happen with any plug strip before.
