Heavy Duty? Yes. You could probably tow a car with them. The price at over $3 each is also very heavy duty. I just want to hang up some extension cords, etc.Adjustable? Not really. The hook/loop sections are about 2 3/4" inches each and if your "strapped object" fits exactly in the plain strap part you're in good shape. If it doesn't then you have a problem.I also bought some off brand hook/loop straps with a plastic D ring and full hook/loop on both sides. Probably won't pull a car but I can wrap a 1" diameter item with an 18" strap if that's all I have. And they only cost 40 cents each.
