Cable feels high quality and overall it's great in certain scenarios. This works fine at 1080p/2K 60Hz. When selecting 2K 120Hz, it's okay *most* of the time but occasionally the image will black out as my monitor tries to re-sync the signal. This monitor had no problem with 2K 144Hz on a shorter cable before I moved things and needed the longer cable. 144Hz doesn't even appear as an option through this cable at 2K (though admittedly I don't think that's advertised, so I was okay with that). I've since switched to a DisplayPort 1.4 cable of similar length and my monitor has been working perfectly at 2K 144Hz. If high refresh rate is important to you, I'd look elsewhere.
