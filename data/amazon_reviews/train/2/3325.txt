I purchased a pair of these back in 2016, and it was the best $6 investment in a solid pair of earbuds. The sound quality is decent, the earbuds are comfortable, they served me very well.Just a month ago, the rubber ear piece finally ripped after probably a year or so of it starting to tear. And since I threw away the original packaging years ago, I had no rubber replacements.So I opted to buy a replacement pair.They worked just as well, except this second pair must just be a dud because after exactly a month of use, the right earbud has stopped producing sound. And I honestly haven't moved them around much or taken them in and out of devices. They pretty much just stay by my laptop on my desk.And of course, the return window closed yesterday, so I can't get a replacement or refund.Tried to talk to Panasonic directly, and I would've had to mail them in for inspection to determine they were actually broken, the shipping for which I would be required to cover.For $9, definitely not worth my time.At the end of the day, I'm just disappointed. I loved my first pair, and am sad to have ended up with a bad second pair. And I wish Panasonic had a little more customer care in terms of working through the issue. Idk why they don't have a better warranty for their products. Even if they were under $10, it's still frustrating.That's my experience. Hopefully this helps in your decision process.
