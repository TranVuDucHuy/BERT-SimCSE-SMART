Audio quality is quite poor. This isn't a fault of my phone, as by the nature of USB-C, the audio is generated by a DAC inside the adapter. Using a pair of DT770 Studio's (80 ohm), a 4th generation Apple iPod sounded significantly better playing the same music.It quite poor dynamic range, and frequency response sounds like it crunches a lot of the mid-top end.As well, when unplugging my headphones, and then plugging them back in, my music (playing in VLC) will rapidly start/stop multiple times a second. This resolves after unplugging the adapter itself from the phone, and will always happen when replugging headphones, despite making what feels like a solid connection.
