I hoped to power my MacBook pro off this, but not a chance. The MacBook power adapter says 1.5A, which should equate to 165-180W for a 110-120V system. Like others have mentioned, it starts with a blue light (working) and MacBook says "Charging." But a few seconds later, the light turns red and the MacBook will notify me that it is not plugged in. It will cycle every few seconds--blue, red, blue, red. My conclusion is that it is unable to provide the sustained wattage necessary. It will power my desk lamp, toothbrush charger and charge my electric razor. So I suspect if you stay under 100-150W, you might be OK. The USB outputs are not "Fast Charging" capable, according to my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. The USB ports work fine and I've charged multiple devices simultaneously, but I do wish it was Quick Charge compatible. I have a Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 compatible 12v charger that has been fantastic for quick-charging devices. Perhaps look for that spec when seeking USB chargers that can charge your phone or device quickly (Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, or "Quick Charge compatible"). Simply seeking higher amp USB ports is not sufficient.Update 4/2022 - I can't even power a 5W, 450 Lumen LED desk lamp off this inverter. The light flickers incessantly and unbearably. This makes me think the power output is not a stable 60hz 110AC sine wave. The Apple Macbook adapter may not be tolerant of the instability, or this inverter can't provide the wattage needed by the adapter. Anyway, this is pretty much garbage and I would not trust it with any sensitive electronics. Small power adapters and analog devices may be OK. But I consider this another example of low-quality Chinese garbage.
