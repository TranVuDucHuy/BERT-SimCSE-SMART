This thing does NOT stay on my vents in any way, shape or form. It is supposed to grip the plastic on the vents but once I put my phone in, it slips off and falls off which is not ideal when you're driving. The only plus side was I bought it for someone with a bigger phone because other phone holders don't allow for the phone to stay in. Do not buy this product unless you're only using it for the for the thicker phone holder part. I do not suggest this.
