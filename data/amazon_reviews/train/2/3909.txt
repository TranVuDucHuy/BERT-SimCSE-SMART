The photos show that the bracket has holes all along it’s length to account for different sizes. In actuality, one of those holes is an arrow shape meant to remind you which side goes up. It just so happened to be right in the spot I needed to make sure the bracket was flush with the back of the TV. Instead I had to screw it on with the bottom of the bracket hanging over the bottom lip of the TV, making it even harder to get the TV straight.Had this stand the ability to change the length of the bracket as needed or adjust the up-and-down tilt of the TV, it would’ve been perfect. Definitely not “universal”.
