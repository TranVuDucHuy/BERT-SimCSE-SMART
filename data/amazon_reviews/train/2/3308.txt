I ordered this microphone after reading a ton of positive reviews. My main use for it was for gaming and zoom meetings.Upon unboxing my new microphone, I found that it was fully assembled (other reviews said it needed to be assembled), which had me slightly suspicious, which I think my suspicion was confirmed when I found that one of the tripod's rubber feet was missing.The microphone cover seems to also have indentation from packaging, but if my suspicion is correct, then this is likely not on the manufacturer and this microphone was returned.The microphone itself does seem very nice and of good construction, however, I cannot seem to get the best sound quality out of it without maxing out my input on the computer. I was hoping to be able to keep about 12" away from the microphone and still pick up my voice well, so this part may be user error as I attempt to try different microphone angles and positions.With the missing pieces and "dented" (it is foam, may reshape) from packaging, I am going to currently rank this as 2.5 stars, but if these wrongs are corrected, it is easily a 4-5 star microphone given the price.
