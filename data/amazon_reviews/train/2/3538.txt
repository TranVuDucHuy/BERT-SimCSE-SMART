I used to swear by the quality of Anker’s charging cables, but now I mostly swear at them. I have to leave my phone on a table while it’s charging otherwise it keeps beeping and the Lock Screen briefly turns on. I thought the previous connector had worn out so I bought this one which does the same exact thing even with my new iPhone. My conclusion is the cable quality had no quality. I’m very disappointed.
