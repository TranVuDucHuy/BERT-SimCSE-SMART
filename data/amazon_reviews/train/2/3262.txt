This worked just fine, until yesterday (3 months after I purchased it). It stopped charging yesterday even when it was plugged in properly to my iPad Air. A pop up message started appearing on screen each time I plugged in the charger saying it was not an authorized charger. I tried the other charger, no luck. I also tried the shorter one I bought about 18 months ago. None of my chargers worked. I then got repeated messages telling me to update my iOS system. I did, leaving the cord plugged in. Coincidentally, there was just enough battery life to get the updates done. Interesting that battery was a 2% for twenty minutes during the process, and after complete, my iPad immediately went dead. I went to the Apple store this morning and was coerced into buying a new charger and new adapter (the USB-c version for a total of $64). My brother told me to get the normal sized power cable that fits in a standard full sized USB adapter made by Apple and sold at several retailers including Amazon. Here it is. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CPS16L4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1. I’m buying this one as a backup. Remember, don’t buy this one I’m reviewing, Apple will make sure it’s not compatible! Good luck.
