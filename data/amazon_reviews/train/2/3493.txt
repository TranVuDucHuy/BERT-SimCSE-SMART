I purchased these to wrap around my large extension cords. The first one out of the package fell apart - was not stitched properly. The tab that is supposed to separate the Velcro pulled out and the stitching came with it. These don't appear to be meant for long-term use, but they aren't expensive, so they'll do for now.
