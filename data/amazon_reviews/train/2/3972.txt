I bought one a few months ago and absolutely LOVED it, so I ordered a second one, The first thing I noticed is that they finally changed the charging port to USBc which I LOVED but the inside fabric changed, it's not as soft, and the ear pads don't move to align to the ears like the first model . It rubs the ear darn near raw. The only reason I did not return was I can use it during the day, but I won't be able to sleep in this one at all.
