This is the second time I bought these. I purchased them because of the length and was ok sacrificing charging time. The first ones lasted a year before they stopped charging. Not great. Not awful. However the new ones need to be seated just right to charge. If you breath on the cord it will lose connection and stop charging. As a matter of fact my phone is plugged in as I type this and the charging keeps stopping because I am touching the phone and slightly moving it. Appears to not seat tightly or securely into iPhone base. Be prepared to get the cord in just the right position and don’t breathe or look at the phone or cord thereafter until your phone is charged. I agree with the reviewer who said stick with Anker cords. That’s what I am going to do.
