I wear glasses and the temple of my glasses takes up the space between my head and my ear. It was very difficult to get this ear bud to stay on my ear along with my glasses. If I put the ear bud on first and then my glasses, my glasses temple was higher causing my glasses to be crooked and out of focus. If I put the glasses on first and then the ear bud, the ear bud would fall off. Also, I wear computer glasses and there was absolutely NO WAY to change my glasses as I sit down to my computer and keep this ear bud on.This is a Great ear bud otherwise. I have used Plantronics, now called Poly, for over ten years but I have always had the monaural in-ear bud that does not require going over the back of my ear.I just wanted this review out there to let folks that wear glasses know to consider it carefully. If you have really tall ears with lots of room maybe it will work just fine for you.
