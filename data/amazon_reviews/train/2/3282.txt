First and foremost, ordered black (or grey or whatever base color it was) .. yet got BRIGHT coral red. Not a let’s fault I don’t believe but more incompetent employee mistakes by none other than Amazon.Secondly, the volume.. is downright ATROCIOUS!! Absolutely positively HORRIDLY and HONESTLY GOD AWFUL. I bought these to use inside and outside of my helmet on my Harley! My bike isn’t even obnoxiously loud, but I do have a head pipe & exhaust (okay maybe it’s semi-loud, 96twin cam bored to a 107ci, fuel moto cylinder heads, Woods cams the works) but it’s made to be quiet until I get on my wrist.. YOU CANT HEAR THESE HEADPHONES WHEN IM IDLING LET ALONE DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHERE THE EXHAUST NOISE IS BEHIND YOU AND ONLY WIND TO DEAL WITH! Absolute JUNK volume/Loudness to these guys!Noise cancellation is semi decent but the transparency and vocal stuff is a joke! Just give me the regular noise canceling, keep the fancy stuff, and give me the volume necessary to hear these!I guess if you’re a Karen, and only listen to Jazz Music at or below 50% volume, (which equals 25% on these), they’d be wonderful for your prude self, but who in their right mind wants to have the sun at your back, the wind at your face, and on 2 wheels with the open road all you’re seeing, and not a car insight.. and not JAM ALL THE way out to Skynard or AC/DC when it comes on the playlist? I can tell ya now, you need an Import back breaker or crotch rocket, not a Harley!All in all it connects to Bluetooth, Has ANC, battery is semi ok. But I feel like they concentrated more on ANC and battery life, which when cranked up I’m sure uses more power, but I could careless, I’d rather have an earbud with 2 hours of battery, loud as I can stand without ears bleeding, half way decent ANC, then no loudness whatsoever, no where near best in class ANC, and long battery! Not even LDAC for my HiDef audio since I have a IBASSO DX220 DAP/MP3 player with dac/amp to play my 16+24 bit music library.. doesn’t matter. Because after ordering I found out that it Bluetooth codec is horrid too!All in all I wish I woulda tried these out sooner, because they aren’t in the return window therefore I’m stuck with them.. luckily they fit inside a motor tube from last 4th of July and I sent them off the way they deserve, in pieces straight to The man down under!P.S. I see now that ALLLLL OF ANKERS EARBUDS, even the new generation of 100$+ buds, have horrid volume capabilities! So lesson learned, order another companies earbuds if you’re riding a harley or crotch rocket, or if you’re not a Karen and want actual volume like normal people, because anker, THREE GENERATIONS LATER, still hasn’t figured out that their doing stuff to these new gen earbuds that NOBODY CARES ABOUT!!!It’s SOO SIMPLE, ANKER, ILL BREAK IT DOWN SINCE THE REVIEWS ARE CLEARLY NOT READ BY ACTUAL EMPLOYEES THAT CAN MAKE DECISION OR AT LEAST HAVE A SAY SO IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS-LOUDER VOLUME FIRST-LDAC CODEC SECOND-HALF WAY OK “ANC”-Better buttons on earbuds-Who cares about battery life
