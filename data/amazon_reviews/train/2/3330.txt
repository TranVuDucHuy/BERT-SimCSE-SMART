I used to love these earbuds, every time I'd need new earbuds I'd replace them with these and I'd get about a good year or maybe a bit more before they ended up wearing down or one of the buds would start fading out, which is pretty good life considering the price and that I'd use them every day and they'd get hours of use a day. Hell, these earbuds used to last better than expensive ones, I once bought $20 earbuds to replace a pair of these that broke and that pair only lasted a month before one of the wire snapped, and when I replaced it with one of these again I had no issues. But this past year I've had 2 of these break on me within a few months. The first pair lasted only 2 months and then one of the earbuds literally broke apart, the piece connecting the earbud (the part you put in your ear) broke off, revealing the wire inside and unable to be fixed. I thought okay, maybe I got unlucky and got a dud, so I ordered another one and it worked well, but a month of use and the same exact thing happened, one of the earbuds broke apart, and I did absolutely nothing to it.I used to love these earbuds and have used these earbuds since 2015 replacing the Sony ones I used to use before and for the past 5 years I've used these earbuds and no other brand and would get one year out of each one. Now they are made like garbage and barely make it over a month before falling apart, the quality of these has dipped greatly in the 5 years since I started using these and after my past 2 experiences with these, I will no longer be using these earbuds any longer. These used to be the best earbuds on the market for under $10, but now they are among the worst and not even worth $1 because they will break within a month or 2.
