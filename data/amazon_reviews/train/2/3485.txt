When I first got this head set it was great. Good sound and everyone was able to hear me easily. I have had it for 2 weeks and really enjoyed it. Starting a couple days ago. The headset would say it was paired and connected, but none of the sound would come through the headset. I checked to see if it was set for media only or calls only and even if it was set to calls only I still had to use the phone because it would not come through. I have tried it on 3 phones and a laptop, all of which it orked fine before. I have the problem even when it is just connected to one device. The only way I can get it to work is if I completely unpair it and then re pair it, and that only works for a few minutes. While great at first, didn't even make it 2 weeks
