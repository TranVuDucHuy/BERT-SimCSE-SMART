Sound quality was admittedly very good compared to other sleep headphones I've used in the past, but these are pretty uncomfortable if you are a side sleeper. The speakers are not adjustable and seen into place unlike other similar sleep headphones, so depending on the shape of your head the speakers will NOT line up with your ears comfortably. For me, as a side sleeper this either meant discomfort as the speaker rested uncomfortably on the outside of my ear, or positioning it correctly on one ear for comfort but resulting in the other speaker being nowhere close to my ear. If you have the precisely perfect head shape for the speakers to actually rest over your ears properly you'll probably like this. Otherwise, I can't recommend these.
