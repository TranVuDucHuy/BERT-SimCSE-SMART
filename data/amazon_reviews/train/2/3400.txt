UPDATE 1/12/22:As I've continued to use these headphones they continue to improve. Perhaps there is a break-in period? These are starting to sound as good as my 2017 pair. If there is a break-in period Otium should let us know so that we don't think they are junk out of the box. I'm soooo glad I kept using them and now I'm back to being impressed with these nicely priced headphones! Thanks Otium!I bought a new pair of these as the pair I bought in November of 2017 are starting to lose battery life. I absolutely love the 2017 pair. They sound excellent, fit nice, the microphone is clear on the other end, etc. I give the 2017 pair 5 stars. I bought the new pair hoping for a continuation of the great product I bought in 2017. Something changed. Is this new pair manufactured by a different company? The new pair doesn't come close to sounding as good as my old pair. The bass is almost non-existent, the volume doesn't go very high and is actually hard to hear at full volume. People I talk to using them complain that they sound muffled. When I use the old pair people tell me that they hear me crystal clear. Why did Otium change this once great product? What a disappointment.
