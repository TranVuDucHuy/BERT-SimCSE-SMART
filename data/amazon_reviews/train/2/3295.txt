Poor product. They feel durable enough. I wouldn't worry about them breaking. But they charge so incredibly slow that they're barely worth using at all. They won't even register power to my Galaxy Watch4, and when trying to charge a 6 year old Amazon fire tablet I'm met with a notification that tells me the charger is too low power and may not charge the device while I'm using it.If you're in a pinch and need these as extras to let things sit overnight it's fine but these blocks do NOT provide the power they claim. I'd request a refund if I cared enough.
