I used to listen to all my music with these panasonic earbuds, and never felt I needed anything else. I've lost them and replaced them several times over the years and was always happy with them. However, lately I've been listening with a pair of AKG earbuds I found laying around. They are the same price as these Panasonics, however their treble is way brighter and their bass actually exists noticeably. More importantly, the AKG earbuds sound more crystal clear compared to these, which sound dull and blurbled by comparison. I compared the two side by side from a few of my favorite spotify songs and a couple of scenes from recently streamed shows/movies (dialogue scenes, action scenes with explosions, etc), and found the AKG noticeable better in every scenario. The tangleless braided cable on the AKG is superior to these panasonics as well. I don't know what happened to Panasonic, but they are just not as good as I remember... very disappointed with it.Link for AKG earbuds: https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Stereo-Headphones-Microphone-Galaxy/dp/B07PTXSHWR/ref=asc_df_B07PTXSHWR/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241977007607&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14715958201647687112&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9011931&hvtargid=pla-682219160298&psc=1The only useful aspect of these earbuds is the noise cancelling aspect of the plug if one of the 3 sizes fits comfortably enough in your ear, which I find they do. Would recommend just cutting the wire and using the earbuds as effective ear plugs to block out the noise when sleeping or working in a noisy environment. I also just noticed It seems they also added a sharp surface on the outside edge of the earbud that pushes against your outer ear, and will leave an imprint on your outer ear if you're laying down with them, so maybe don't use them for sleeping after all.They somehow managed to ruin an already great ergonomic design by adding this sharp edge to the outside brim. The only explanation I can think of is they moved their manufacturing factory plants to China.
