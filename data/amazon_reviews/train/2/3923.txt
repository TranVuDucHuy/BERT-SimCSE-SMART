Good voice quality and volume but the battery won't last more than 2-1/2 days without even using it. My old Voyager Pro HD battery lasted about a week when turned on but not used (and the headset lasted almost 10 years before it died). I downloaded the PLT Hub app to turn off all sensors, HD Voice, Streaming Audio, etc. and made sure the firmware is up to date but it made no difference. I need to turn off the power when not using the headset to slow the battery drain. Luckily the headset connects quickly when I turn it on. I returned the first one I bought due to what I thought was a defective battery but the replacement is the same.
