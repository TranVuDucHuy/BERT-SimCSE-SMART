I had a really nice set of headphones but when I got this phone it did not allow me to use it because it does not have an auxiliary cord port. Baby I'm searching online to see what I could find and this one came with good reviews however - caution - YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE YOUR MICROPHONE. I was not able to have my head set plugged in and use my speakerphone on my phone nor was I able to use my microphone on my earbuds. It works well if you want to listen to music and charge your phone but not use your phone.
