So i purchased this "up-graded" version, since i had one of their older versions I purchased over a year ago, and boy....what a let down. My new S22 and my wifes new Iphone 13 both take double the time to charge at 50% 0r less battery. On their older version we could charge our phones in 30 in or less at 50% battery. With this new supposedly upgraded version it taking my S22 approx. 1.5 hrs to fully charge and my wifes 13 is approx. 1 hr to charge. So does it charge....YES....is the upgraded version faster than their old version....Hell no!!! I contacted their customer service and they told me to try using a different charging apparatus.....so I took the charging cable off the old version and it performed the same. Tried the one from my daughter's ph one charger...and no change. I asked for them to swap out this one for their older version, and they said they'd get back to me if it was possible. 3 Weeks have gone by and not one response back, so I guess thats a NO. Looks like I'm out the cash on this upgraded version and will have to spend the money on the other version, since I know it works as a FAST charger....this one is not FAST!!Not sure how you can sell a "fast upgraded charger", but it doesn't work remotely as good as your older version!!Very disappointed!!!
