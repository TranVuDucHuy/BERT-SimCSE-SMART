It is near impossible to use this product if you wear glasses as it needs to be wrapped around the head/ears and glasses will get in the way. The band has speakers loosely fitted inside of it, you have to move them around to fit them over your ears, but if the band shifts at all while wearing it, then the speakers also move off of your ears and make it hard to hear. Iâ€™ve tried moving the speakers into the most comfortable position, but the band still has to be uncomfortably low on my face to the point where it is almost covering my eyebrows. I am not able to have it sit at a normal headband position and be able to hear the music from it.
