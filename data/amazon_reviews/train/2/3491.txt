I really enjoyed this headset. Decent sound, fit and battery life for the price point.The problem I had is the case. Yes, lightweight and compact for what it is, however two days ago it fell out of my pocket, now it won't charge. Headset works fine but case will no longer charge it and I don't see where I can get a new case. I have had it for two months, so just outside of Amazon's return window.Bottom line, a three foot fall shouldn't kill the device, especially not in two months. I like it but not enough to shell out $50 for a replacement every few months.So 2* for now. I'll update if the case starts working or I find reasonable replacement.
