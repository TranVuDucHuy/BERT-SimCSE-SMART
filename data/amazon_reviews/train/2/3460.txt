Bought this to extend my insanely short cord for my Samsung Galaxy Watch4. Plugged it in and nothing... Unplugged the cable for the watch and plugged in the cable to my Galaxy S22+ and it started charging immediately. Unplugged it and plugged in my work phone which is an Apple iPhone 12. Charges fine.I then realized that there's nothing wrong with this cord except that it is incompatible with the proprietary Samsung Galaxy Watch4 charger. Seeing as this is the SOLE reason I bought this cable it only gets two stars from me. I'm sure it will work for a plethora of applications that you might need this cable for, but for me, the only reason I wanted it was for my watch and it didn't work.I recently tried to use it to extend the cord for my daughters Amazon fire tablet. It doesn't work for that either... And this cable is made by Amazon.I was going to make a video to show all this but figured it wasn't worth my time...
