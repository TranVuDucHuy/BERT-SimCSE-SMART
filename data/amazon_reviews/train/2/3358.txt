Wire is CCA, not good copper / OFC, which is to be expected at this price. My main concerns with this kit are the fuse and wire size. Fuse looks to be a fairly large size, isn't labeled, which is usually a bad sign. On top of that the wire is undersized, measures .90"-.100" after the insulation is stripped, which is NOT 8awg wire! For reference, some good Southwire stranded pure copper 10awg measured .105"-.115"! Someone is going to burn down their car if they try to use this "8awg" wire to its supposed potential. If you're running an Amp that's a few hundred watts or less you'll be fine, otherwise spend the money on REAL hardware.
