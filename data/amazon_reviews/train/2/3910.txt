The *minimum* VESA is (200mm wide). This requirement is not communicated clearly.Readers are instructed to “check your VESA” and the Amazon advertisement explains that “the mounting holes distance...must be less than 24 inches (600mm) horizontally...”.Great, my specs are 100mm. 100mm is less than 600mm. Should fit, right?Nope. The advertisement fails to explain that the *minimum* distance between the holes must be 200mm.I have a limited time to be alive on this planet and I just wasted 30 minutes of it. That doesn’t include the time I spent working to get the money to but the stand.Please provide adequate max/min specs when being helpful. Otherwise, it is probably an okay purchase.Thanks.
