I use this headset almost every time I talk on my phone. The battery life as been excellent, and the sound quality is good for the most part. However, the noise cancelling built into the mic seems nonexistent. It doesn't matter if I am outside, in my car, or inside, people on the other end complain about the level of noise my mic picks up. Even something as simple as setting down a coffee mug renders complaints of loud bang from callers. So instead of noise cancelation, it seems the mic is overly sensitive. About the only way I can use it is to sit still and do nothing else but talk on the phone, but the reason for being hands free to do other things while on the phone. So it looks like I'll have to find a different one.
