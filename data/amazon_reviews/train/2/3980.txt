The cords just don’t work very well. My phone will be plugged in and then all of a sudden, it stops charging. If I bump my phone slightly while it’s plugged in, it will suddenly stop charging, even though it’s still plugged in. There’s no fraying of any wires that I can detect. They’re just not great quality.
