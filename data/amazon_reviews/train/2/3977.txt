I should've known before i bought these. Please be advised, the main problem with ALL these cheaper lightning cables will be their measurements, im not sure if they do this to avoid completely copying the apple cables, to avoid any kind of retribution, or what, BUT, as you can see from my images, these are about 6.6mm in width, and the apple website states their are about 7.7 which is a significant difference, and as a result, the cable fits LOOSE and WILL NOT CHARGE the device unless you "wiggle" or "jimmy" it to get it to make contact, and as well all know apple devices are temperamental about this particular thing. So, i am returning and getting an original apple cable. Which grinds my gears because apple is over pricing abuse at its finest. These cables actually look like they're made well, BUT, of course, the tolerances hurt their overall quality, but having to pay apple through the nose for the same quality thing is complete BS.Cheers.
