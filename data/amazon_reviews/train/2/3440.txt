Not a fan. The gray covers over the outlets started falling out immediately. Strangely difficult to actually plug in to outlets. Outlets so close to each other that you can really only use every other one. More of a 3 outlet surge protectorI've never had a bad surge protector before this one .. usually they just work the way they should. Not this one.
