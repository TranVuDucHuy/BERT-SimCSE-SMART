I myself liked having just 1 charge cord for all my electronics. This cord didn't pick up a charge from any of em. At all.I have 2 sets of Bluetooth ear buds. Neither picked up a charge. Nor did my phone. Tried my kindle. nope. tried my tablet. Nope!!!!I have a Samsung A02s for a phone. Hmmmm I wonder if the newer statik cord works instead.
