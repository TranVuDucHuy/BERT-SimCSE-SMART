It's definitely a well made cable but I bought this for my son who uses his phone to play video games, etc. That means he is always moving the phone around, actively using it and the cable would just fall out of the phone portion, not a snug fit. He has an IPhone XR but the ports should all be the same size. Had to return them. If you plan on just leaving your phone lying down to charge, it would probably do the trick. Can't speak to how quickly it charges because we didn't keep them long enough to notice.
