Update: I worked with customer service, which was Amazing. The wiring harness was wrong too, it seems they make two different ones for those years Aveo. One with two plugs, the other just one. Each harness and mounting kit is different. Anyways customer service went out of their way to help me. I was super satisfied dealing with them and getting the problem fixed very easily.It's your typical cheap mount but with what it needs to do, there is no reason for it to be of higher quality.However, this does not fit a 2007 Chevy Aveo as stated by Amazon. In the companies defense, while many GM vehicles are listed in the manual, no Aveo is listed. So this is clearly an Amazon error or a listing error.If it will actually fit your vehicle there is no reason this unit wouldn't work for you.
