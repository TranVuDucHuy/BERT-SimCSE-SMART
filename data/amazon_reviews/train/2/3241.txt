First let me start off with I had left a review prior to this, it was deleted. Kind of shady if you ask me.This light could be great but it seems to have a defect in the LEDs. I received a replacement and all seemed well, and then it did the same exact thing. I mean a couple of LEDs out of the whole bank isn't going to be a major difference for this little thing. It does alright in photography, but it's honestly not bright enough for much unless you're right on top of your subject. However it does make for a handy flash light with good battery. Fantastic to grab in a power outage.I'd say it's a solid 3/5, but it gets 2/5 for deleting a bad review. It's somewhat handy, but don't expect much for photography/video especially in already lit environments. If they could fix the LED banks and make them more solid these would be great.
