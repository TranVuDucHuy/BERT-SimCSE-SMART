After receiving and installing the ground led light failed to illuminate showing it was properly grounded. I had a friend who is an electrician check my outlet and breaker box and all was good with grounding. It seems the led ground light just doesn't work. Lucky for me my friend didn't charge me but i can imagine people buying this and if the ground light doesn't work becoming worried about there home wiring. Could cause an unneeded bill from an electrician.
