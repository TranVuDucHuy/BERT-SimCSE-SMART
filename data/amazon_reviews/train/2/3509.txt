This is a very good printer - business quality letters. Not so great with photos. But I am giving this only two stars for one important reason: you are locked in to using Epson ink cartridges. The printer rejects refills and substitute alternative cartridges, and worse, once a cartridge is empty, the printer REFUSES TO WORK. So if you are in the middle of printing and you could live with blue ink instead of black, it still will not permit you to print. It simply says, "You need to replace the following ink cartridges..." I don't think there is a work-around. As so many others have commented, the cost of the ink outstrips the cost of the machine. But OK, that's not uncommon anymore. But to be prevented from printing at all? That sucks.
