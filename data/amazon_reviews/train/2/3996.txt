I like the idea of this charger / 3.5mm adapter. However, I could not get the microphone to work with my Pixel 6a for phone calls - using a Bose sports headphone or a Samsung headset... I tried two different adapters, but neither worked for me. I ended up ordering a different adapter (USB Type C to 3.5mm Female Headphone Jack Adapter) on Amazon and it worked! The downside, it does not have charging capability, but I really wanted it to work for phone calls. Just wanted to pass this along for anyone else using a 6a for headset calling.
