I have printed about 25 pages (black & white) pages and about half way through when it started smudging or skipping therefore you couldn’t read what was printed. I cleaned the print headers. I thought that would eliminate the problem but NOPE. About every other page page I have to clean the headers again. I bought the manufacture brand because they said that it would eliminate problems. All I’ve had are PROBLEMS.
