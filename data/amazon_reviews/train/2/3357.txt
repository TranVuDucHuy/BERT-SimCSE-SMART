This kit should NOT be the #1 all-time best selling amp wiring kit! I was duped by the popularity, underestimating the cheapness of the average Amazon user.The pics show the power wire from this kit, next to pure copper speaker wire from Sky High Audio, so ofc it's going to be better connectivity, however I'm focusing on the wire count. The speaker wire on the right is 14 AWG! They have almost exactly the same wire count, just the insulation on the SkyHigh is much much smaller. Crazy that I'm going to be replacing my amps' power wires with speaker wire, since the pure copper is going to be much much better for connections.This kit is trash, but I guess it was good experience to practice on some cheap materials before I replaced them with legit wiring. That should be the only use for this kit, practice crimping stripping soldering whatever on the aluminum before replacing it with some real copper wire. Wish I saved that $20
