I bought this headset in April 2022 and it worked perfectly for me, the only thing was I couldn't move more that 5 feet away without losing the connection. However, I've recently had issues with this headset on the Vonage app where in the middle of calls the other person will no longer be able to hear me. I was still using the headset for Microsoft Teams until this week since I'm now having the same issue, in fact Teams doesn't even recognize the headset anymore. I've updated my computer concerned that might be the issue but it didn't help. I tried to get support on their website but since I didn't register my product I can't get support. A lot of money was invested in this headset for it to stop working in less than a year.
