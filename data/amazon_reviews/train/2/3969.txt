I was soooo excited about this product! I legit lay in bed with ear plugs and this guy over the top with the soothing sounds of anything or anybody. I have now gotten used to having the sound all night but the battery has pooped out and only works 3-4 hours now. So it dies, I wake up and try to convince myself to go back to sleepðŸ˜©. Iâ€™m seriously considering buying another just so I can trade them out in the night.
