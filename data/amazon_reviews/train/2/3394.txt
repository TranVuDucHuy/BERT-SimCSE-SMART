I've bought many Otium headphones in the past. For the most part I've been pretty pleased. Chords do not have any resistance to tugging, so if you pull or bump the cord in your earpiece too hard it will disconnect on the inside very easy. But they're cheap. However, this last pair I bought has basically been malfunctioning since day one. I tried to find the company, without living a review on Amazon. But couldn't find a contact. These are inexpensive headphones, and I go through them once or twice a year because I'm tough on them. But this last pair, was not even the same product. It didn't even register on my devices as an Otium product. When I first hooked them up, the volume was super loud, but I thought okay now at least I have that option to turn it up loud. Now Volume it's not loud at all, and decreases on its own. I have to keep cranking it up every 5 minutes. If you crank it up all the way to the top it resets to low. Now I can't even adjust the volume. Totally useless.
