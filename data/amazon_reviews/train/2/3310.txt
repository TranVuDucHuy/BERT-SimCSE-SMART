Run through the settings in your default laptop recording mic if you have one. Chances are it does two chanel audio "studio quality" this mic does single channel "dvd quality" audio. It also pics up too much feedback. I did a direct recording of me saying the same thing into this mic and into the laptop mic and the laptop sounds better. Should have known for the price. 2 stars because I mean..it works and it's plug and play.
