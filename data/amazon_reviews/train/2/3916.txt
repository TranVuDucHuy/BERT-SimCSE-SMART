I ordered this on July 30, 2020. I was weary though as the reviews were all over the place. But I NEEDED something that was compatible with the phone system that I use for work & it needed to be Bluetooth. Well it seemed ok at first, UNTIL a week later of using it I tried getting up & walking just 10ft away, & luckily I was only talking to a coworker at that time, because she was like umm.. you cut out really bad..& I couldn’t hear anything you said after the first 3 words. I was kind of discouraged by that. So ever since I have just been careful really. As I NEEDED a headset & couldn’t afford to buy another new one while returning this one. The last 2 months, this headset has been cutting out HORRIBLY & I can’t even use it on the opposite side of my head from where the Bluetooth piece is plugged into the tower for my computer, which is literally 6 inches from me, without it cutting out every other second. It’s HORRIBLE! The noise cancellation never worked. Everyone could hear everything in the background since day 1. But again. I didn’t have the money to purchase something different while waiting to return this one. So I’ve just dealt with it. And honestly I regret not returning it because it’s only gotten worse & worse every day since I received it in the mail. I use it every day M-F for at least 4-5 hours out of the day. & charge it whenever it requires to be. I don’t over charge it. & always keep it in a safe place when not being used.I do have to say the sound quality is def not what I expected. It’s also not very good. I can have the volume turned all the way up & I find myself still pressing it into my ear & my other hand over my other year just to hear half the calls I receive & make. I’m truly disappointed in this product. Especially because it’s supposed to be a good brand.Absolutely do not recommend!
