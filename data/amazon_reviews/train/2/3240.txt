Â For 11 months, this light got the job done. Mountable on a rig, chargable with USB-C, lights are adjustable and switchable on-off. To that extent, it does the job admirably. It casts a nice beam of light on a subject and is, indeed, a flashlight alternative because of easy ergonomics. I used it standalone for walking my dog on many occasions, and charged it after use.However, it is not built to last. Yesterday made that clear, after 11 months of ownership, charging the light turned itself on even though the switch was set to "OFF". The light began flickering on and off on its own. Then it stayed on for about 15 minutes before dimming slightly. Flipping the switch on/off did nothing to turn it back off. I noticed a sweet, ether-like smell emanating from the light. This smell is indicate of a punctured lithium battery.Since the light's housing has never been opened, exposed to rain, exposed to excess shock or immersed in liquid, I'm left to wonder, how is that even possible? I'm aware that with enough charges, any lithium battery will wear down, and I get that. But I didn't expect a company to completely throw its hands up in the air and refuse to take accountability for a product that's clearly defective.When I sent a message to Ulanzi's customer service the potential of replacing the product under a warranty claim because the product was defective and potentially dangerous, they said they had none."dear friend, Our products have 3 months of unconditional return and exchange services. But your order has been close to 1 year, so there is no warranty. thank you for understanding. Best regards Ulanzi "But I don't understand, Ulanzi. These are not your "best" regards. These are your worst regards. Why is it so hard to stand behind your products by offering a warranty? I'd rather have a light than doesn't go BANG in the middle of the night and starts a fire.Super disappointed in Ulanzi. Get another brand.
