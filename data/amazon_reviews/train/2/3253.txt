First off, i like Jaybird best earbuds i had were their old wired ones so decided to get these . The fit is great, the noise cancelling and and sound is very good, the design sets it apart from other earbuds in a good way. The issue starts with whatever the jaybird app software is doing to the earbuds. To explain if I have an app (Spotify, Youtube, etc) already playing sound before connecting, the earbud will not continue to play the sound when they're connected. I don't mean it pauses the sound, the video or song will still be playing like it's connected to the earbuds (because it is) but no sound comes from the earbuds. To get around this I have to disconnect the Bluetooth then reconnect for it to work. This issue is not just when I'm connecting it the first time, if I pause the music/ video more than a few seconds it will do the same thing.Went online to look up the issue and I saw that you have to uninstall the jaybird app to stop this happening, uninstalled the app and it worked. Thing is, the app is how you modify the sound quality, noise cancelling, and other features. So if I want this to work well I need to either leave the app uninstalled, keep disconnecting the bluetooth, or keep uninstalling then reinstalling the app.Like the title says, wanted to overlook the issues and keep these, however for the price these are the issues are waayy too annoying to overlook
