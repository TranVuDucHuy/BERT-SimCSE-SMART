Don’t get me wrong they are comfy but to justify $25, I don’t think so. Maybe it’s from the sweat from working out, maybe not made to last in order to make you buy more or the ones I got are defective but they do not last. Not that it’s a huge deal but they are a little difficult to change. If the merchant sees this you’re more than welcome to reach out to me.My suggestion keep your $$
