I’ve had this charging cord less than three months, and it’s already having the issue where it doesn’t charge if the cord is bent a certain way. I got this cord because it was longer than my other ones, so I could charge my phone while laying in bed and keep using it. I’m really disappointed because I normally love Anker products, and they’ve never let me down before. Looks like I’ll have to switch back to one of my shorter cords while I find a replacement.
