I attempted to use this to install a subwoofer. The power wire was significantly smaller gauge than other 8 gauge wire I had in the shop. The connectors are cheap garbage, and the fuse box was similarly cheap. Once connected, I got intermittent voltage across a 12 foot run from the batter to the trunk of a midsize sedan. I replaced the wire with some extra InstallGear wire I had. Everything worked. Replaced the fuse with an InstallGear as well. Donâ€™t waste your time and money.
