I wanted to love these so much because I just didn't want to spend $200 on Airpods...but they were disappointing. I only had them for about 3 days before returning them. My biggest issue was that they're way too big for small ears. As soon as I put them in, it felt like my little ears were being stretched out; i thought maybe i just needed to get used to them and wore them for a couple of hours for a couple of days, but that didn't help at all, my ears were sore the whole time I was wearing them AND after. So yeah, skip these if you have small ears.Other issue is that i would have to keep reconnecting them to my phone pretty much everytime i would put them away and then try to use them again. They don't connect easily, even after the first time of connecting them to my phone. Oh and forget connecting to multiple devices. I tried to use them with my iPad, and I would have to turn off my Bluetooth on my phone and then manually reconnect to ipad and vise versa. Nothing major, but very tedious if you use your headphones a lot.I've never had noise cancelling, but felt like they worked well enough for me in that department.As for sound quality, it's not the best, basic, but it works if you don't care too much about that. I will say though, sometimes the music sounded like it was far away... Not sure how else to describe it. I'm assuming it had something to do with the different noise cancelling settings.I did like that you're able to choose what you want each individual earphone to control,like volume, noise cancelling, skipping, etc.Wouldn't recommend if anything I mentioned bothers you, but Im sure they would be an affordable option for kids or teens.
