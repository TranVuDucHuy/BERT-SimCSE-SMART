After a series of short-lived charging cables for my nightstand, I bought this cable thinking it'd have the durability advertised. About a week ago it started only charging if I plugged it in a certain way (and yes, I cleaned the port on my phone). Last night it stopped charging completely, and I woke up to a phone battery that was at 40%. For the price of this, I could've bought two charging cables at Wal-Mart that lasted twice as long.
