So, this as well as the color cartridges gave me the blues in setup. The black cartridge did provide more consistency in levels but eventually it too gave me trouble.The trouble- printer may or may not recognize these OEM cartridges. If it does, after maybe two or three cleaning cycles, your printer might not even recognize it or say there no ink, when there is clearly ink present. I think it has something to do with the little float inside the cartridges where you see the ink. I had to do the electrical tape trick (YouTube) just to get it to recognize the cartridge to finish my setup of printer.Also, if one cartridge goes out, forget about printing with your brother printer. Supposed to go into black and white one side printing but good luck after your cartridge says no ink or not recognized.
