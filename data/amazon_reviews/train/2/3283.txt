So, I've been using Anker products and wireless speakers for quite a while, never had any issues with them, so I had high hopes for these earbuds. I'll lay it all out;Sound quality is excellent, the bass is great. I use these primarily in my place of work which is typically very loud, these can block out practically any sound.Fit is okay, not a huge fan of earbuds with the little rubber earpieces but I could learn to handle them, and they fit okay with the smallest ones anyway so I could overlook it.Battery life is great, since buying them like a month or so ago? never had to charge them once, but I did once or twice anyway because I liked knowing they wouldn't die on me if I did overuse them.Now, the reason they are getting a two star review: After a month or so of use, the right earbud has completely died on me. I saw a review from someone else saying one would cut out for a while and then come back randomly or switch back and forth. Its very frustrating when I need to cut out a lot of noise to get my work done and I simply can't since half of it doesn't work.I dislike the fact that there is no manual way to turn the earbud on, I just have to hope that when I take it out it'll turn itself on. I know it isn't the battery or not getting charged enough, as I have made sure they are charged and tested them out a few times and still nothing.I know it isn't me being too rough on them, my old earbuds which were a cheap $20 pair I had for well over a year with my proper care lasted so long.Not a huge fan of the delay in the controls on the earbuds themselves, either. Its often easier to stop what I'm doing and pull my phone out to switch songs or pause than it is to get the controls to work.For the price these are, I don't think $80 is worth the sound quality and the app control, since they will just decide to stop working properly and the ear fit is not great. I will be getting a different brand for earbuds next time.
