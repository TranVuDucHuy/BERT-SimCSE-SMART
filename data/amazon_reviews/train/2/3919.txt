Noise cancelling, good range, announces caller, hands free answering, volume control, switchable for left or right ear use, and a neat little carrying case/charger... what more can you ask for?1. While the talk time is decent, I found it to be short of the five hours claimed. The real problem is when you shut it off. Let it set, turned off, for a few days and it will announce, when you power it up, that there is 3-4 hours of talk time left -- with a full charge it says that it has 5 hours of talk time. Charge it, turn it off, wait a week or so before using it and you will be informed that there is 1 or 2 hours of talk time remaining.2. The sound is tinny and hollow.3. When talking, you hear a tone a couple of times per minute.4. On and not actively being used, the app sends an alert to the phone constantly.5. When wearing you look like a one eared version of Dumbo.I bought this to replace a wonderful, full-featured unit that developed a problem with the on/off switch. That one had all the features, would keep a charge apparently forever, excellent sound quality, was very small - barely stuck beyond the bottom of my ear, and used just a wire hook around the ear. Unfortunately, after six years, it is no longer on the market. While this unit has most of the features of my old unit, it has some major short comings so I am still looking.
