I bought this for my cell phone and it's very limited in it's use. If you want to hook your phone to it in a vertical position and see it on a table top where no one and nothing would be able to knock it over then this will work. If you want to turn your Apple phone horizontal don't let it go because it's going to fall over. It's short thus the tabletop. I bought this on a whim when I was going to be joining family for dinner and wanted to be in the pictures for a change. I lost the remote so quickly I never got to see if it even worked. Don't even consider mounting a camera on it. Waste of my money and I can't return it now.
