We loved this speaker while it was able to charge. It looked great, was water proof, and was a constant companion to our outdoor workouts. But the battery won’t charge. No matter how long we plug it in, it doesn’t get past about 14% charge. The speaker works for ten minutes or so, then dies. We’re very disappointed because it every other respect it was perfect for our needs.
