Disappointed. Everything I read said this was an excellent microphone. Everything looked good, but when I hooked it up I couldn't hear anything through the headphone jack. When I played back what I had recorded, it sounded static-y and rough. Pretty sure it was a defective unit as I've heard great things about this mic. Returned to Amazon for a refund.
