Nothing bad to say. They're great!! Exceeded expectations!Came back to update on 12/13/22..the left ear bud now has minimal sound. And they are very uncomfortable to wear. Not enough cushion and with every little movement, they are constantly falling out so you have to readjust them. So went from 5 stars to 2.
