I expected it to be undersized due to it being Boss Audio and after reading the reviews, but even I was shocked.I ordered this 8AWG Boss kit for my 500watt amp knowing that with a typical kit all I would need is a 12AWG wire. A typical 8AWG kit (not this one) should easily handle 1000watts... I figured I had compensated enough, but I was wrong.This "8AWG Power Wire" that comes in this kit is FAR FAR BELOW 8awg...way below a 10awg, and I am confident is not even as much as a 12awg wire!I compared it with some pieces I have laying around to be sure, and sure enough, the power wire in this kit is NOT even as big as 12awg wires I have!I've included pictures of some 8awg Rockford Fosgate side-by-side with this kits 8awg Boss wire.... that is just shameful! Not even in the same ballpark!I FAR overcompensated knowing this would be under-sized and I STILL will not be using this pitiful excuse for power supply wire that comes with this kit.As for the rest of the kit, the ground is sufficient although also severely undersized. The remote wire is fine because it is a standard low-watt signal wire. The speaker wire is decent as not much is needed for that as I'm just running 80watt miss and highs (you will NOT want to use this for a Sub though). The RCAs are waaaaay too long for my application (excellent opportunity for picking up road noise and interference) and are visibly shielded poorly at best. I knew that when ordering so already ordered proper-length RCAs. Even the connectors included are mediocre at best...the soft covers are nearly unusable as they are terribly undersized for the connectors as well.I ordered this expecting very little from the brand and was STILL very disappointed. Boss really needs to pull it together and at least TRY to get near claimed specs. This is false advertising and bordering on dangerous claiming these sizing/power-handling abilities.
