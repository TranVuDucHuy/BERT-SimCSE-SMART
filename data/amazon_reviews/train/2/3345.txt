Big design flaw. Unlike many other tag holders that have a pocket and the tag slips in from the top. This isnâ€™t like that. The seal which is all the way around can easily come apart with the AirTag falling out. Everything else about this is great including the fastener and clasp but unfortunately the security of the tag is in jeopardy if you use this holder.
