I host a podcast. I keep my primary mic on a boom arm that's connected to my desk. It literally doesn't move.I bought two of these mics back in October. One of the two mics failed in early January.There was a constant clicking sound that could be heard in the audio recordings. When I swapped out the mic (kept all the cables the same), the problem went away.I tried to get the mic switched out under warranty but Samson's RMA process is a complete joke. It wasn't worth my time to go through their silly process.Based on the reviews, I assumed I just had an outlier bad unit so I ordered another one.Here we are in March and the new unit has now failed. The audio cuts in and out. Again, the thing sits mounted on a boom arm. Cables are all tested and they work fine. When I put my backup mic in, everything works fine.I'm left to assume that these mics just aren't good quality. Very disappointing.
