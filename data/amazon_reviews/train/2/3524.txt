Got one for Christmas and decided to buy another one for my car. They both quit working within days of each other, we tried both android and iPhone and neither worked. The magnet isnâ€™t as strong as they say, there would be days where it would fall off and or just not charge properly. When it did work it would charge really slow! Just buy a cheap charger it will last longer then this.
