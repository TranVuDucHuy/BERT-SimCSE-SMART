The product works really good at first, and I’m not sure if it’s just my chemistry or the conditions I have them in (I tend to be out in the elements riding my bike in the Midwest), but they wear out really quickly. The outer coating fell apart and essentially took away that “memory foam“ feeling. So it’s a little bit more challenging to get them to stay in my ears at this point. It doesn’t make for a good fit once they get like this….
