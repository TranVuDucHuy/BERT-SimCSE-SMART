The knob where you tighten the screw attached was so sharp it scrape my finger,it was not smooth. I have bleeding on my skin. What a disaster !!! The screw clamps easy get loose & unstable tripod too. Easy connection to blue-tooth.Look at the picture across the black knob, on top is the gold around is the winding of the knob. The sharpness surrounded, it scrape my skin. Horrible, how on earth can this metal so sharp. Abuse ! They have to pay me for this skin damage. Totally not happy with the incident.
