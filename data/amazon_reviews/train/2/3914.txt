I purchased this for my wife who is working from home and answers calls through a program on her computer. When a call comes in a window opens allowing her to answer or decline the call. She currently used the speaker and microphone in the computer. When I installed the USB to make the connection with the earpiece, it would not allow her to answer the incoming call. When I disconnected the USB, she was able to answer calls with no problem. For some reason connecting the USB to the computer had an issue with the WE CONNECT program she uses for incoming and outgoing calls.
