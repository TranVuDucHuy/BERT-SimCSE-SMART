Does what it's meant to do well enough and sound quality is good, but even a few weeks after use this thing starts having issues. Static, clicking, disconnecting, and sometimes a LOUD electronic screeching noise randomly. 2 and a half months later, it no longer connects to my phone (Galaxy S22) at all. No, I didn't handle this thing like it was my firstborn child and it was bent, but I don't think it should break THIS easily. Get it if you absolutely need it or can't afford good bluetooth earphones, but be ready to get a new one every 2-3 months.
