I have many Anker products that I love but there is something wrong with the battery on these earbuds. They either do not charge fully or only have a battery life less than 3 hours long. I have a previous model, the P2 that I can use all day without ever running out of juice but I got this pair to leave on my desk just for work use. If I use for over 2 hours I receive a 'battery low' warning and have to drop to one earbud while I charge and swap for the remainder of my calls. The case is always fully charged but the buds never seem to reach a full battery. Case in point, I had them in the case and plugged in all night in advance of a 4 hour conference this morning and even triple checked everything was in correctly and lights were flashing but when I checked their charge level via my laptop after being on the call only 40 min they were ar 20%.They do have good noise cancelation but perhaps buy an older model if you are looking for battery life.
