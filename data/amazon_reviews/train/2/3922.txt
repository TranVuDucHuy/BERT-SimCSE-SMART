I liked this headset at first. I had the older Legend headset and I would say that one was a little more comfortable. The new one is only slightly bigger, but enough to not be as comfortable. Something I never got used to for the time I was able to use it.The noise cancelling was much better than my old Legend. Although, I saw great reviews for the old Legend on here for that. The one I had was terrible. But the new 5200 was great in that respect.The battery life is excellent especially with the charger case. I could go about 4 to 5 days without needing to plug it in depending on the length of my conversations. Which were usually a couple hours 2 or 3 times a day.The problem I had with this headset is that the mic or something went out at about 3-4 months of use. No one could hear me anymore. It went from being a great headset to being completely unusable. Another reviewer on one of these Plantronics headsets (I forget which one, might even be this model), mentioned there's some issue with eventual sound degradation. Well I guess they were right. I don't remember for sure but I think my old legend basically did the same thing. This one just did it MUCH quicker. $125+ for only 3-4 months is terrible. If I could've at least gotten a year out of it, it wouldn't be so bad. But 3 months?!The only other thing I am not a fan of, even with the old version, are the ear tops. I prefer ear tips that direct the sound into your ear canal. If you have these and feel the same way, search Chockolotta. They make an adapter with some tips that I liked better.Anyways, it's a great headset until it's basically useless in a few months. I won't be purchasing another one of these.
