Honestly was very excited for this! I felt a touch let down when it just didn't seem to pick up my voice when sitting 5-6inches in front of me. I practically had to be touching the microphone to get my voice to come in as loud as it does with my headset. Granted I would not expect it to be super loud, but when everyone you talk to says you sound a hundred miles away.... it might not be a useful product. I would like to caveat this with the chance that this particular one might be a lemon, so your own experience my differ!
