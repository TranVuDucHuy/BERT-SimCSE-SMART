The foam on this product rips very easily, it’s very delicate, and doesn’t seal as well as I would’ve liked, being someone with a smaller ear canal. When I was removing them for the first time, (to try and find the correct size) the first pull already ripped out some foam. I will admit I was a tad bit forceful with it as it wasn’t budging and so I tried to pry it out at the edge with my nails, and each time more and more bits of foam came off, until finally I pulled it at an angle as they suggested and the whole foam bit just came off as per the picture. The next foam bit I followed their instructions more carefully and a piece of foam still ripped off unfortunately, with me simply using the padding of my thumb. Aside from the quality, this did help my AirPods stay in my ears just a tad bit more but in the end the AirPods still plopped out. I work out in them, and find it difficult to find any solution so I wasn’t expecting much from these tips. Everyone’s ears are different I would suggest trying them and just being as careful as you can when replacing/testing out sizes due to the delicate foam.
