Bought for a CRT Computer Monitor (Compaq CV735)Why? Because Analog to Digital is not a smooth transition. And also, this adapter didn't have a positive connection to the B in RGB and my monitor appeared to have a yellowish tint to it. After fiddling and kinda twisiting the connection around I was able to get a good connection to it all and it appeared normal. The monitor itself seems to be fine overall. But that little issue tells me that this wasn't a good fit and could prove unreliable.
