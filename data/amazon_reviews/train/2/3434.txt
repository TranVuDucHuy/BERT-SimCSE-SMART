I looks decent despite the badging, it does everything that it says it does. In my specific scenario, the nearest outlet was on the left of the rack about a half an inch out of reach. Had to return it for this reason. If the power cord was on the left, it wouldnâ€™t have been a problem. The reason for the low star review is based on value. For the same price, you can a surge protector with 12 outlets and a 15ft power cable.
