The product never remained connected. It was always dropping connection even when the device it was paired to was with in arms reach.I even went through all the steps of trying to fix the issue via the provided you tube videos and they were well made, easy to follow and would work for a time, but then they would eventually loose connection once again…However, when they worked I was really happy with them, but got too frustrated with them constantly disconnecting and having to rest them by putting both ear buds back into the charging case.I am returning…
