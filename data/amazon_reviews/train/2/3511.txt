I purchased two of these from Prime Pantry a while back at a price that seemed too good to pass up. They gummed up the print heads. Each time I wanted to print black I had to first clean the print heads. My recent purchase has been better but if I go a week or so without printing I need to clean the print heads first. I don't have this problem with the colors.
