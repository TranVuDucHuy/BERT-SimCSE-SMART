When I hooked up this device between my Dell Precision 5560 laptop via a Dell docking station, I noticed that the external monitor was not very bright and not as sharp; it was significantly less bright than the native screen of the laptop. Now before anyone jumps down my throat saying that I have something set up wrong, I did another test using a Benfei DisplayPort to VGA adapter, and it works exactly as expected (i.e., proper brightness and sharpness to monitor). As this is a work computer locked down by the IT department (i.e., I cannot modify any BIOS or Windows System settings), I cannot really do much debugging as to what is going on here. I am sending this adapter back, and getting a second DisplayPort adapter, as the first one is needed for another computer.
