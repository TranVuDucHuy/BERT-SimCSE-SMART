I’ve only heard good things about these earbuds. I bought a pair and tried them out for myself.It took me a bit of a struggle to connect them, but they did eventually connect.The sound is fantastic and is very diverse. You can use the app to change what kind of bass and tone you like and it gives off a very different kind of sound experience also a very good volume.The button controls are good and the tap feature is a little finicky. Tapping the earbud to get it to do what you want sometimes takes a couple of tries but eventually works. The buttons are a little hard to click, but they do work…like buttons.They fit in my ear extremely well. There are some wing-type earbuds that will hurt the inside of your ear after a while. These don’t do that. They fit like a glove and do not fall out at all.The grips I have with these earbuds are that they have weird connection problems more often than I like. Sometimes I’ll go to put them in my ears and they won’t hook up to the phone. I’ll be randomly listen to music and doing work and all of the sudden, it’ll just shut off. Then I’d have to bring them to the case to reset. And then they’re okay for a while.While you go to unpause the music, it will take a few tries to get the music going and sometimes you’ll have to pull your phone out to unpause the music you are listening to so that the earbud registers that it can now be a functional earbud again. *Update* they have gotten so much worse for connectivity. Sometimes they connect, sometimes they don’t. And sometimes I’ll be randomly listening to music while working out and then they’ll just cut out. Then I have it walk all the way to the locker room to put them in the case just to reset just for them to do it again later.Overall they sound really good and they are really comfortable, just clean up the Bluetooth quality please and refine the tap feature. If they cleaned that up, it would be the best Bluetooth earbud to date
