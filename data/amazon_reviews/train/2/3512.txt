The cartridge was dated as advertised and worked for a while. However, the printer refused to recognize it after a couple weeks, and I had to replace it with a newer cartridge, which worked perfectly. Something was wrong with the one I bought here, but I did get about half of it used before it failed. I will probably not buy short-dated cartridges again.
