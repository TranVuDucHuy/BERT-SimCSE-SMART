Doesn't fit well. The positioning of the ear loop in relation to the actual bulb/earpod(for lack of the precise description) is simply not in alignment and therefore is impractical. To actually stick the thing in your ear the loop part can't at the same time fit around your ear. It may fit well for others, but unfortunately that isn't the case here.
