I'll start with good stuff:- Fit and comfort- Decent soundNow the problems:- Issues switching audio sources. Often requires multiples tries or placing buds back in case when switching between PC or phone or watch- Needs reconnecting when switching apps on your phone! Not even kidding. Want to go from YouTube to Instagram? Audio drops and forces reconnecting. It's extremely frustrating.- Struggles to filter mic noise on phone calls. People on the other end say I sound like I'm in a wind tunnel with a slight breeze outside. No settings helped with this .- Phone software is clunky- Sometimes buds charge in the case. Sometimes they don't.Summary:I only recommend these to people looking for a pair of gym headphones they'll never need for anything else. I don't recommend for anyone else.
