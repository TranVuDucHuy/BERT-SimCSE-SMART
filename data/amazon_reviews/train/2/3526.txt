Cable end is like a dirt magnet constantly having to pick anything it touches out of the groove and wipe the surface to make contact if it could levitate it would probably be ok, seems like it will save your charging port last longer but I can’t get it to charge sometimes, then I have to pull out end and put lightning plug in to charge I have 2 Statik factory cables 3’ and 6’Plus extra heads all cause same problem
