I purchased these to replace a similar cheap pair that I loved and lost (Letsfit IPX7). Ear buds don't stay in for me and I like to have the part that goes over the top of my ears. The speakers still work, and they have excellent sound cancellation. The microphone however stopped working. When I make phone calls, either the person on the other end can barely hear me or can't hear me at all. Frustrating.
