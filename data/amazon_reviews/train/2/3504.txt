What lured me into buying this was the label that says "Extra High-capacity 50% more prints*" Don't miss that "*". The thing is this: when you receive the item and look all over the packaging, the "*" asterisk is never expanded on. That is, they don't tell you what "50% more prints" actually means. I.e., 50% more prints than what, exactly? In other words, they insinuate that this is a seriously "Extra High-capacity" cartridge that will produce LOTS more prints, but they never quantify it. I could be wrong, but I think it's just manipulative, misleading packaging. Does it work? Yes, so far. It works fine. It's just that it doesn't appear to be any kind of terrific deal that I'd been led by the labeling to believe it should be.
