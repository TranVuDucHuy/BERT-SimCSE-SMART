I purchased a second one of these as I was so pleased with the quality of the first. Everything seems to work ok on the second one, but as you can see in the photos, straight out of the box it’s OBVIOUSLY been damaged, which any professional will tell you is NOT good for a microphone.2 stars awarded because it IS functional at least, and sounds ok for a mic that’s been damaged, AND because the first one I ordered last year was pretty much perfect. 3 stars overall deducted for quality control- I should never receive a brand new mic that looks like it got dropped off a ladder or some other tragedy.
