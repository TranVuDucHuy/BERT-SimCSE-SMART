I received a pair of these as a secret Santa gift about 5 years ago. They were super cheap, but had good sound and noise cancelling. I loved to use them for music and calls. I bought a second pair for my laptop when work from home started. Also great.My first pair finally stopped holding a charge so I got a third pair, or so I thought. This item was more expensive and is not branded anywhere with the otium logo. The quality is poor by the old standard and it is quirky. I'm not even sure this is a real otium product.The sound is poor, it randomly drops connection, does not play nice with my PC and speakers and mic change randomly when on Teams calls, volume controls work when they feel like it and it has inferior range. It's a shame because this was once a great headset for cheap.
