I have purchased AmazonBasics cables in the past and I still use them today. When I needed the USB extension cables I did not hesitate to buy the same brand again. The first time I used the cable was to connect my RUNMUS K1 RGB to my PS4. I kept randomly losing connection for both cables. The RUNMUS K1 RGB was cheap compared to my other headset so I thought it was probably the source of the issue. I did not use the cables again until recently when I started using the cables on my computer. My WD easystore external hard drive is how I determined it was the cables that caused the issue. I was already using the hard drive so I know the USB port was working. When I switched over to the extension cable my hard drive started to disconnect and reconnect over and over again. When I unplugged the extension cable and plugged the hard drive back into the same port it worked with no issues. Despite the issue with the cables I received, I will probably continue to buy AmazonBasics brand cables. I should have tested the cables as soon as I got them. There is always a chance of getting bad cables no matter which brand you buy. Just make sure you test the cables before the return/replacement window closes.
