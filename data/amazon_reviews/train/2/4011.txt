Extremely thin cables with cheap connections. As long as you leave it in one place and don’t carry it around with you, they are ok. But definitely not sturdy enough to stand up to much at all.Do they work? Yes. But that’s all I can say good about this product. Next time I’ll spend a little more for better quality.
