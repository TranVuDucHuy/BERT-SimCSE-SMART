I bought it to sing songs on Simule. The microphone is good (not considering that the voice is very loud, most people should like it). The main problem was the headphone part. I used different headphones and connections to make it work for me but it didn't. Finally I bought a headphone that it was working with but this time the microphone and the headphone were not synchronized. It was good when I was listening but once I listened to the recorded version there was a time lag between my voice and the song, and it was very considerable when songs beat were more quick, I could fix the lag in some but not in all of the them. I was very excited to try it but it didn't work for me so I need to return it and look for other options.
