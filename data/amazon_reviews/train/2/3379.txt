I bought pairs one works great no issues at all the other only the left ear would work. Which is a chance when getting refurbished items. But when I returned them I had to pay for shipping on something that didn’t work. Kinda disappointed in that considering over never paid for shipping on anything that I’ve returned to Amazon.
