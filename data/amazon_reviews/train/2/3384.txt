If you look into description of Brother cartridges on Amazon.com, they mentioned - "It yields approx. 260 pages". By no means is this statement even close to truth. I print regular text and sometimes Amazon return labels and these cartridges won't last more than 100 pages. I have tried buying them from Amazon.com, Office Depot and Staples, no difference in results. I use Brother printer since 2017 and its unfortunate that their LC201 cartridges don't satisfy their claims. Also, they hide their customer service email somewhere deep under their website so customers can't find it and complain. Print quality is reasonably good but expect to order refill cartridges every 2 months or so for regular printing.
