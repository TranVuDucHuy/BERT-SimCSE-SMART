We like to have 2 on hand at all times as you never want to run out in the office. This is the 1st time we have ever opened a bad toner. Under my ordering section it says we can not do an exchange... (we just opened it)I would have given 5 stars as the product is usually very good. But for the price, to receive an exploded one and not be able to replace it.... NOT GOOD.
