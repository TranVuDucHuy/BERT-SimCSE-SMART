The stand was relatively easy to assemble, at least. However, I ran into a few problems.First, it did not include screws that worked with my TV, a Samsung QNA series. The M8 screws were the correct width but combination of length of screw and spacer prevented the tv from having some severe tilt. I ended up purchasing the screws and spacers recommended in the manual for the tv. Even so, the tv is slightly tilted up at the bottom. Not ideal when itâ€™s around eye level.Second, and more importantly: it was not level, and I could not put it together in such a way that made it level. It had some left to right tilt; I went through construction multiple times to try and see where the problem originated. I figured it out but there was no way to fix it. I ended up sliding spacers underneath the base on one side.
