Epson and other manufactures of printers write software to make it difficult, or impossible, to use competitive ink. The ink coststo replace the low filled ink that come with the new printer run close to half the cost of the printer. Not a happy economic outcome. And with Epson it seems if I only want to use black for 99% of the printing I still have to have all of the colors with levels of ink that operate and they use the colors in some refreshing activities.The Epson also puts black ink streaks on the first several envelops that are printed. I have just started sending the envelops and make them as printed with a new Epson. I got tired of throwing away three to five envelops each time I need to print one or two envelops. And I went through the clean cycle to try and avoid this problem.
