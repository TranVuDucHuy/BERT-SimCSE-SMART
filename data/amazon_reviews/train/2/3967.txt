These were a flop for me. They are very thin and not padded at all so you can feel the ear pieces and control pad pressing on your face. They also do NOT cancel outside noises unless maybe its on really loud which it never is since I use it for sleep. The biggest issue for me is that this thing dies after a night or two. I have to charge it CONSTANTLY.
