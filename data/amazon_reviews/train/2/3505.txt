I've been happy with this printer and ink in the past so I'm giving two stars instead of one. I buy the OEM ink to avoid printing problems; HOWEVER, the last one that I bought was defective. It leaked black ink all over the inside of my printer.Amazon is amazing and is exchanging it for a new cartridge. (I love their hassle free return policy). But it took hours to clean the inside of my printer and it ruined my entire print job which was on the second side of a two sided print process when all the pages got smeared with streaks of black ink. That means I also lost half the ink from the color cartridges as I had to re-print the entire job.I've never had this problem from an OEM cartridge before, but it only takes one to change my opinion and leave me severely disappointed in Epson. I'd expect that this could happen from a re-fill, but from an OEM? Maybe it's not worth the money to buy the cartridges new from Epson after all.
