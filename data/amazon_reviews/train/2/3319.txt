Bought this to use with Skype. Unpleasantly surprised, the rear rejection is pretty mediocre - the mic picks up a lot more noise than I would expect. Worse, the isolation for the capsule must be pretty mediocre as with the mic on my desk it is absolutely unusable while typing. Mechanically conducted noise is really loud. Nice that it includes this small stand, and the mic is compact and looks sharp, but I tested it against the Blue Yeti and while you could go either way re: sound quality, the practical aspects with the Yeti's better rejection and isolation make it no contest.
