I was only able to use the microphone one time. The second time I tried to use it, it was recognized by my MacBook but didn't pick up any sound. The headphones are actually still functioning fairly well, despite the fact that they're falling apart already. If, like me, you search for online support for a product whose instruction manual is less than helpful, you will be out of luck if you need help with this. The support section I was led to on the Samson site gave support for other products. The page for the Q2U only has the instruction manual, which comes with it. I will say, though, the one time I got to use it, it was easy to use. It was instantly recognized in GarageBand and picked up sound fairly well. You have to be sure to use it in a quiet environment, depending on what you're doing with it; when I used it, it picked up the running shower in the background two rooms down from where I was (with the door closed). All in all, it's pretty good for the price, especially for beginners and people not used to recording. It's a better than spending hundreds of dollars equipment and software if you're not going to use it all the time for serious business, if you will, and it's easy to learn the basic functions. I just wish it hadn't clunked out so soon.
