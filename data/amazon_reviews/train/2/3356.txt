Based on the reviews, I expected this wiring kit to be much better than it is. I should have known but maybe I can help someone else. If you are wiring for a very low wattage amp, 200-300 watts, this kit should work. 8g power wire is rated to run up to 500 watts but I would never try running 500 watts with this kit. Note the image. Wire on the right is from this kit, wire on the left is a smaller piece I had left over from a reputable audio company wiring kit. The difference in the cost is over $80 between the two kits. I am guessing Boss measured the outside of the insulation to come up with 8 gauge wire vs. measuring the actual wire inside the insulation. I am also disappointed with the fuse holder (very, very cheap) and the ground wire was only 25" long - not 3'. Spend the extra money on a RF or another brand because you don't want to go through this process more than once - like I am doing now.
