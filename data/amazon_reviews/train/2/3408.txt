Got these for my 1.5 year olds second flight. If I can barely hear anything from these things in the quiet terminal, could you imagine how helpful they were on the plane? I get the low volume safety feature, but they are practically on mute and frustrated my child and us parents. Also, way too many confusing buttons when you just want to whip them out and have em work.
