I bought these because of the rave reviews for people with small ears in hopes that they'd be more comfortable but alas they have failed. While smaller than many other ear buds the hard, contoured plastic still presses against my ear. Even worse, it has a seam at the exact spot where it presses against my ear making it very uncomfortable.I was also disappointed that there were only 2 size cushions in my set. 2 sets of small cushions and 1 set of large. There was nothing in between.The cord is very short which I did not notice when purchasing which is really annoying. I use these at my PC plugged into my GoXLR and I can't even lean back in my chair without ripping the jack out.Sound is just ok. There are better sounding earbuds on the market in the same price range.Should also note the cord is extremely thin and flimsy. I wouldn't expect these to last more than a couple months with regular use.I would not repurchase.
