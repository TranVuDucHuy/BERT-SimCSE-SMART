Shipping was fast. Pairing the Bluetooth to my phone was easy and simple. The speaker was loud and had great sound quality for a portable speaker. Hover the speaker died and refused to charge. I used the charger it came with and left it to charge while at school still nothing! I switched outlets and let it charge overnight but it still wonâ€™t charge please help
