The headband material is flimsy and feels cheap. It isn’t breathable and my forehead was soaked in sweat almost immediately.The flimsy nature of the cloth means the speakers will easily slip around and off the ears and the shape of the band means it won’t stay in place over the eyes.Another review mentioned the control box and I can confirm that the little square box is mashed between your eyebrows and across the bridge of the nose. I’m a light sleeper and the discomfort made it impossible to use for sleep.There is no noise cancellation- the slip and slide nature of the speakers make this impossible and will not mask any external sound whatsoever.I have long thick hair which makes it a real chore to position in any useful fashion. And it immediately slips all over the place once I lie down wearing it.Definitely not worth even the cheap price.
