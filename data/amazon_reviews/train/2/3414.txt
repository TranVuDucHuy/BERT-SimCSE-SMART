I bought this in mid-May and it worked great. While it worked, the charging was quick and it fit in nicely with my wfh desk. It has a good weight and stayed upright with no issues.Unfortunately, a couple of weeks ago it started charging very slowly. At first, I thought it was the charging cord, so I replaced it and that seemed to fix the issue until this past weekend when it just stopped charging. I tried 3 different cords and 2 different outlets just to make sure it wasn't something else. It wasn't.It was only $14, so it's not about the money; it's about the inconvenience. It lasted less than 3 months and now I've got to spend time to find another charger that hopefully lasts a long time.I gave it 1.5 stars because when it worked, it was quick charging, but that doesn't mean much if it's not going to last.
