I have the original Samsung white buds and these "international ones" the original buds cancels noise way better and the ambient sound is also not as impressive like the originals. I would have coughed the extra bucks for the regular ones if I knew it wasn't going to be the same quality.. I got these because my original ones battery life isn't lasting as long as they used to
