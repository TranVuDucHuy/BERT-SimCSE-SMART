Nice, solid design. Sufficient weight on its own that it does not just slide around on a hard surface. Charges like a champ! And, it is a fine fit for the iPhone SE 2020. With no case on the SE, it is just a tiny bit wider than the phone ( .5 mm total?). With a basic bumper/wrap style case, the phone is just enough wider to make it easy to grip when picking the phone up, without hanging way over. Totally recommend, especially for SE 2020(Important Update:) "Fix" for Apparent Charger Failure: Reboot the iPhone? Yep...Only 6 weeks after purchase, the charger just plain died, or so it seemed at first No green light, not charging.But, placing the phone face down (the wrong way) resulted in the LED flashing blue, which is a warning signal to flip the phone right way up. So the unit was not completely dead.It took a while to figure out, but I eventually found Nanami's "Amazon Seller Messaging Assistant" dialog on the Amazon site to contact them requesting warranty support.Nanami responded by the next morning (Nice!) and suggested that I try Rebooting my iPhone (Power down, restart.)End of problem. (What the Heck is Up with That???) Apparently, there is some firmware running within the iPhone that controls wireless charging. No idea what caused that code to glitch. But, rebooting resolved the issue.
