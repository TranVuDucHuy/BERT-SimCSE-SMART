The product works well for sound. Barely any battery use after 1 night. Headband is not very comfortable as a sleep mask. Material has a sports jersey feel. Box even said sports headband. Product isn’t as wide as pictures portray. (Less than 3”) It seems like it would be ok as a sports head band but when you pull it over your eyes it feels awkward and not comfortable. I would not recommend this for sleep. I will be looking for a better option.
