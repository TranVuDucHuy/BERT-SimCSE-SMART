When I got this in a mail the box was smashed open with everything loose inside the package it was shipped in and looked like it was ran over. Not sure if it was the usps that did that or if it was shipped like that because the Amazon envelope looked pristine. I was mad enough I wanted to return it because I wasn’t sure if I got everything it’s supposed to come with. I only needed a few things out of it I was missing to finish an install so I decided not to because I didn’t wanna wait. The wire didn’t look like 8 gauge to me compared to 8 gauge kicker wire I already had and the included remote wire and speaker wire looked extremely cheap and thin. However I did like the fuse holder and the rca cables but that’s about it.I guess you get what you pay for most likely not going to order this kit again.
