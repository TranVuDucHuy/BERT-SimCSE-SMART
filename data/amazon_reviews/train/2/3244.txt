Product works great. My review was taken down previously so I’ll explain my rating. First off, packaging was fine. Product did not come damaged and the Amazon packaging was perfect. No issues there whatsoever, so it’s not a a packaging error. My issue with the product was that my charger was missing. There were pieces missing when I received this product. I’ve bought these before and I know they come in a small little box with their charger, instructions, etc. However, this time all of that was missing. My light was just thrown in there without all of the other things it needs to come with. Not a packaging issue on Amazon’s side. Seller forgot to include some stuff!!! Please stop taking down my honest review.
