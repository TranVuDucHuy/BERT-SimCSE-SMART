I go through a lot of earbuds. I wear them for 16 hours a day plus. I also lose one or more quite frequently.These were my favorite. However, I lost one after 6 weeks. No big deal. Happens to me all the time which is why i usually spend $20 on earbuds. I used the left earbud for another two weeks with no issue. Charged and recharged multiple times. No problems just using one. Then the left earbud stopped working. It would only play at the lowest volume level.This is a known issue with these since they have trouble shooting steps in the app for this very thing. None of those steps worked.I contacted customer service and was honest that i lost one but that i wanted the other one replaced since it was a manufacturing defect. They had me provide a bunch of information only after which they refused and offered me a small discount on a future purchase. The shoddily built disposal E waste coming out of of China is a problem; the companies build crap on purpose, try to get you to buy more crap, and all the chemicals and plastics just end up in a landfill.
