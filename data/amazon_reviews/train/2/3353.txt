So, many reviews here call out how the wire gauge is nowhere near accurate. Based on other wire I have bought, I may agree. I ordered the 4awg kit because of the other reviews. However, while it doesn't seem to match up, based on specifications from various sites, the 4awg matches to the measurements. It does seem smaller diameter than what I'd expect from using 2awg and 1awg in previous installs, but wire gauge doesn't just double diameter with each increase. 4awg is ~0.20 inches, and while I didn't get out my calipers, it seems to be quite close to this.My biggest issue is with the fuse block. It uses set screws to clamp the wires, but because 1) the wire strands are very fine and 2) there are no ferrules or other blocks in the set screw terminal, the set screw simply pushes through the wire and does not create a proper connection. I ended up cutting the rings off the included terminals and using those as a sort of ferrule, however because of the poor quality of the set screw/body, it stripped out the set screw.I do believe overall it is a decent value but needs a proper way to mount the fuse block. Even a different terminal setup with a square/curved block inside the opening would allow it to function perfectly fine. The ring terminals did start to crack during crimping, so not very good quality either.The RCA cables are decent anough, the remote cable is small gauge but decent enough, and the plastic tubing is fine. I would suggest to anyone using this to get an upgraded fuse block and different ring terminals. Otherwise, everything is working well using a Boss amp and an old 10" Kicker Solobaric.
