Overall these were pretty comfortable and the sound did not disappoint as much as I expected it to. I am an audiophile, and while it sounded quite good, in my opinion to a trained ear, you could still tell that there was spatial manipulation happening in the background, which over time for me - caused a bit of audio fatigue. My biggest issue over though was even though the noise cancelation works quite well for the listener, the microphone and zero noise cancelation to it... actually if anything the microphone is highly amplified, and every sound, tick, knock or voice around you could be heard with great intensity. I was in my office with a closed door and the person I was on the phone with could still hear everything happening outside my closed door, clearly. For these reasons i chose to return the headphones, and for most music-only listeners, these would probably work great, but for me - it did not fulfill my needs.
