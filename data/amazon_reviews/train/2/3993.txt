I received this and it was too small. The position of the openings for the cords are at an angle, so the power cord doesn't sit straight in the box, because of the rounded corners. It fits diagonally in the box. Because of that, it's too small. It's also not white white. It's more of an off-white, almost cream color. I returned the item for these reasons. The plastic does seem very sturdy though.
