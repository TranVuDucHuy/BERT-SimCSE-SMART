I absolutely loathe giving bad ratings, but sometimes it cannot be helped.Perhaps during the Covid quality has changed. Because I loved the factor that this mic was interchangeable from USB to XLR as I do have an interface.A few others mentioned about having to plug unplug the mic for EVERY audio recording, and they were correct.My new Windows 10 system did not recognize the mic after I plugged in the USB. Nor would Audacity for the matter. So I switched out to the XLR but STILL had to readjust the settings, and plug unplug again. Which became hugely irritating as the USB and XLR mics I purchased from my local music center connected and work just fine.Finally when both my sound adjustments and interface detected the mic plugins, I did an audio check and the quality was terrible. Way too much 'hiss' interference, even after making MORE adjustments, including turning the mic way down. Sorry Chuck. But that doesn't work for me in a professional studio session. I returned.
