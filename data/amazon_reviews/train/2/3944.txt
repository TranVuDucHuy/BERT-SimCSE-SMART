Previous review:5 starsThis microphone is great. The sound is really good. The only issue I have with it is that it picks up sound too good for me. I didn't consider my usage when getting it. I would have been much better off with a microphone that captures a single voice instead of any others in the room. At least it sounds great![edit: I learned I had the gain WAY too high (+20db) and mic too far (2 ft). I've since moved the mic to about 2-5 inches away and 0-10db of gain and it's much better now. *chef kiss*]Update:I've been plagued with a problem for the past month. I've tried many different things and I've narrowed it down to 2 possibilities. 1) The microphone is bad or 2) All of the usb controllers on my motherboard for some reason just now decided to start having issues with the microphone. While there is potential for (2) to be true, I think (1) is an easier explanation.List of things I've tried (in no particular order):* use a different port (tried basically all the ports)* use a different cable* try on another computer* update the firmware* uninstall and reinstall the driversI've given up and have decided that while it's a good microphone, if it's going to break in this time frame it's only worth 2 stars in my opinion.Update 2:It seems like after some further troubleshooting the problem may be due to the fact that I had recently tried using the microphone in a USB switch. I'm still noticing some issues, but it seems to be mostly better. Without the microphone plugged into the switch, I had the microphone go crazy and just output max volume static for seemingly no reason. I'm sure that wasn't fun for people to hear.
