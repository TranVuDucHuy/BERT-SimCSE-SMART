It works as expected, the only thing is it s not stable so when you open it tall it shakes for some time then stops like all my video are shaking in the beginning. Donâ€™t recommend if itâ€™s to use for content creation o would say just for family pictures etc but not for professional results . I wish I am able to return it but didnâ€™t notice this issue until itâ€™s passed return window ðŸ¥¹
