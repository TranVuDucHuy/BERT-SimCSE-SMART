 I was super happy to get this product then I noticed they did not come with any kind of charger cords so we found the corresponding charger cords for each one mine(C-type) got done charging within 30 mins or so and my fiancés was still charging we assumed it was it was just dead! After watching mine charge in excitement I noticed that his never lit up! So I’m looking at the headband trying to turn it on and it kept turning off like immediately after I turned it on! I kept trying to figure out why it would not stay on then I looked inside the port itself I had no connection!!!!! He was so sad he was looking forward to us wearing them in the gym together! I have it a two stars because mine worked of course!
