This earpiece comes with a case that is supposed to charge the headset. It claims to hold a charge. I went to use the earpiece and it would not connect so I put it in its case and the charging light was green. I took it out to see if it would work now and it does not. I can only guess that the connection is not tight in the case or the earpiece is defective. This one was more expensive than previous ones so I was hopeful. I am gettting really tired of these not working.
