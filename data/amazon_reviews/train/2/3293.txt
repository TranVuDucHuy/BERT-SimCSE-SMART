When you plug it into your phone it says "fast charging", but the time that it takes to actually charge is the same as a standard charger. I noticed because my phone was at 90% and it said "fast charging", but 22 minutes until it was fully charged. I plugged the phone into another charger and it said "charging" and 22 minutes until it was fully charged. These are decent chargers, although they feel cheap, when you tap the side you can hear something kind of moving inside. However they are NOT fast chargers. Returned and looking elsewhere.
