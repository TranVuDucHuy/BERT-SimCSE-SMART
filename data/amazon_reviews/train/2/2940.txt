Since my cords are 12 gauge this was much too small and would not even sit flat on the floor with only one cord installed. From the description I expected to install two cords but this seemed inadequate for anything more than household extension cords. Probably a nice product if that is your intended use. Definitely not a commercial grade cord cover.
