I bought this mic because it had great reviews and a lot of gamers use this mic to do commentary I have purchased and reviewed a few different mics this one has great audio quality when it comes to sound but when I hooked it up it had a blue ambient light inside that glowed which i thought was very cool. But now after not even 2 weeks and using it 2 times the blue light is gone the mic works great and this could just be me being picky but if I pay this much for a product, I expect it to work longer than 2 weeks, very disappointed, but the mic itself still works so like I said I may be being picky but I loved seeing it light up blue, also it let me know that it was connected and working by being lit up, now i have to test it before each time I record to make sure it is working. Will not purchase again.
