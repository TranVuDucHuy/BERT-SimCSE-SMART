This converter worked great for the first month. We are living on 12V and use this to charge various devices that have AC plugs. The unit has a cooling fan that quietly hums in the background. After a month of use, that quiet hum turned into a loud screech. I blew out the device thinking it was just dusty, but the screech continued. The screech happened two days after the return window closed. I don't recommend this unit for continued use.
