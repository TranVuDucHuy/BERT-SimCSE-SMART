I get better sound quality and control from my gaming headset. I was hoping that this would be a good microphone for voice recordings/voice chat but the mic is so sensitive that I can’t even touch my desk or rub my fingertips on my keyboard without it being incredibly loud in the mic. It picks up an incredible amount of background noise as well as white noise. There is no EQ you can access to change these. But I guess it’s better than nothing.
