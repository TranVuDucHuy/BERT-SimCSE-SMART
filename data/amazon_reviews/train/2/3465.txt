I bought this to support a hybrid meeting setup: to connect to USB 3.0 "superspeed" hub across the room, which would have a basic webcam and external USB monitor.The hub is powered, and the monitor was connected to the port that featured the highest output. When I used this cable to connect to the hub, it would briefly recognize the monitor and then would disconnect. When I switched to a different cable of the same size (can't remember the brand unfortunately), it stayed connected to the monitor. When I added the webcam to the hub, it continued to function well with the powered hub and the other cable. The ONLY way I could get the amazon cable connected was to connect the monitor directly to the cable, skipping the hub (defeating the purpose of having a USB 3.0 superspeed hub).All the other cables, devices, and connectors I've mentioned have the "superspeed" logo on them, but when I checked the amazon cable, the cable casing said "PREMIUM USB 3.0 CABLE - SUPERSPEED DATA TRANSFER" but the connectors themselves do not have the "superspeed" logo. It makes me wonder if they have actually been USB-IF certified (a requirement for using the logo).
