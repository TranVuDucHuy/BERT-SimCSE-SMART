I purchased two of these at the same time, and they both eventually stopped charging consistently. First one stopped after a year, second stopped after two years. They can still charge but stop charging any number pf seconds after plugging in which is not reliable. The way it happened was my phone was dying, and I plugged it in and the charging sign was on. Since the charge stopped without my knowing, my phone died and the phone alarm did not go off. It almost cost me dearly had I not panicked when waking up about why I felt like I had been asleep for a long time. These aren't completely useless if you were really desperate and had the time to constantly supervise that the charge is still going until you got to the % that you need. Don't expect them to work reliably for more than 1-2 years. I have other phone chargers by different companies that still work after 10 years. I just wanted these for their cord length but they are not reliable in the long run. Would not purchase again
