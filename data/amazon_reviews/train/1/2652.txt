Stopped pairing after 4 months. I didn't use it often, so it's a drag it died after 4 months.Sounds fine for a tiny speaker. Good for podcasts. Not amazing for music, but good enough.Doesn't have its own volume control. It requires you control the volume on the device you're paired with which is inconvenient, especially in the shower.Convenient for travel.Convenient in the shower, has a hanging loop.Was initially easy to pair with multiple devices and then it just stopped pairing with any of my devices.Now it just powers off when I click the pairing button a second time.
