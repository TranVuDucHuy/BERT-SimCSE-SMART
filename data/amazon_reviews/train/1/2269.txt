I'm using a Macbook Pro 2020, connecting the AT2020USB+ to the computer's USB port (using an adapter to USB-C), and the volume is barely acceptable when System Preferences volume and input volume within GarageBand are at 80-90% (see photos). I contacted Audio Technica: First they suspected the problem was with the laptop (not true: A different low-cost USB microphone works fine, no volume problems). Otherwise, they suggested that I return it to Amazon and order a replacement.The replacement is a little better, but not much. Perhaps it's because of having to crank up the software volume, but the sound quality is also disappointing.So, I'm returning the second copy to Amazon for a refund.If you also have a Macbook Pro 2020, be aware that you might run into the same problem. Be sure to audition the microphone well in advance of the Amazon return date.
