DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS A FIRE HAZARD. I’ve used these cables for over a year, I bought 4 and now I really wish I had read the reviews. I heard a strange sound coming from my phone last time I plugged in and the cause was the charger was burning my phone and nearly burned my hand as I unplugged it. It kept getting hotter even after I removed it from the phone and continued making noise, I had to unplug it completely from the outlet for the heat to finally go down. If I had left it alone it would’ve caused a fire and could’ve burned my home down. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I will be throwing all my cables out. This listing should be removed I’ve seen several other reviews mention the same issue this product is a safety hazard and is going to cause a fire and potentially get someone killed if someone leaves their phone alone in the wrong place
