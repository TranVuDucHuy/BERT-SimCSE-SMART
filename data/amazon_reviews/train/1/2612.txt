I bought this to replace the adapter for my school computer so I could project PowerPoints for my students. However, it blinks in and out constantly. At first I thought maybe it was a sign that the port on my laptop was going bad, until my school provided another adapter and that one worked fine. This one, however, doesn't work well at all. Couldn't use it.
