No good for windows, last update was for windows 7 or 8...I don't remember, but it was many years ago this mic came out, no updates obviously, problem with mic volume level, I sent it back.Shame, because I own high end AT equipment...from many years of use and respected the brand, but I ended up getting a yeti mic for my computer based recording after this
