Not biast!- they don’t go very loud and I’m not picky at all! They also would disconnect Bluetooth constantly with my phone just in my pocket. Ive bought several cheap headphones like these and these ones really suckFor me personal- headphones were loos in the ear so sound quality went way down. I don’t prefer the rubber ear bud style so this parts kinda important. I got the Amazon’s recommended on the first page I searched as replacements and they are 1000% better
