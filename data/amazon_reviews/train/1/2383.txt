DO NOT BUY FROM TONOR, If your a DJ do the smart thing and actually buy a good quality microphone from a legitimate company with good customer service. Don't cheap out on these, you pay for what you get. Here is my story:I bought two sets of these. With my first set I really didn't have too many issues. I knew these were cheaper microphones and starting out as a DJ I was trying to cut costs. Yes they cut out, yes they have interference but again this is because it's on the cheaper side so it's to be expected. I moved on to a Shure SLX-D Beta 58 and gave my second set which I hadn't used to another DJ.The moment he plugged it in the second set DID NOT Work. I called to get a replacement set and the tech team had me run through a series of checks. I did them all to no effect. So I wrote them (you can't call) to request they initiate my warranty. They told me to buy a new receiver and if that didn't work then they might possibly send me a new unit. Wait so I spent $100+ on this unit that never worked and you wanted me to spend another $50 to see if I could possibly have it work. The unit never powered on. I'm not buying a new adapter or receiver off amazon to execute my warranty. Does Apple tell you if your phone doesn't work to buy another phone and replace the parts out? No. 9 MONTHS LATER... My Warranty still hasn't been honored.They are the absolute worst. Don't do it, just don't waste your money otherwise you'll end up like me and others using microphones that break easily and cut out repeatedly. It's up to you, I just wish someone warned me before.
