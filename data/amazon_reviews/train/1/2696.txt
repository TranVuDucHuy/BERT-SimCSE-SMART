My first attempt to plug in something was met with heavy resistance; as if I'd run against a brick wall. In another slot, the plug slid-in without any (and I mean any) resistance -- and it fell right out. Playing around with it a bit, it would seem that the receptacle beneath each plug opening isn't always aligned properly - resulting in my brick wall and fall-out encounters. Hard to believe this is actually a UL approved device.
