***UPDATE***After posting the review below and on the manufacturer website, I was finally contacted by the manufacturer. I was given a return label and once delivered, they sent out a replacement pair. They just came in last week so it’s a bit too early to tell but they seem to be working fine at the moment. I just wish I didn’t have to post a bad review in order to speak with customer service.***PREVIOUS***Great for a few months then one stopped working completely and the other has super low volume. Did all the tricks we could find online but no change. Too late to return through Amazon so went to the manufacturer. No phone contact info, email only. Took over a week for a response and even then all they did was ask me for the same info I already entered in their website! Almost a month later and issue still not resolved. Don’t even want money back, just wanted replacement due to manufacturer defect. Absolutely disgusted with the lack of customer service from Raycon.
