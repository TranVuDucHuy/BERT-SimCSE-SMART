This is the second time I order this one–this time by accident (thanks so much, Amazon suggestions!)– and the second time I have the same problem. I had forgotten that last time I ordered this (again, thanks for the suggestion, Amazon!) all my Apple devices rejected it immediately. You know, that “device not compatible” message thing that starts popping up when it’s that time of the year to charging cord, except the cords were brand new. It’s not just that, though; I have to be careful how I set my devices down and not to touch them, otherwise they start screaming at me because the connection gets interrupted. Anyway, I don’t make a fuss and just order a different one because it was just $10.Well, it’s that time of the year again, and I, again, ordered the top choice without giving it much thought. All I really care about is that I want a long cord, and $10, again, seemed like a good deal for two of them. After I ordered it I had a deja vu moment, but didn’t really give it much thought. Then, of course, I get the package and when I plug it in, again, I get that “device not compatible” pop up. I also have to be careful when I set my devices down and not touch them... anyway, you know how the story went from there, and my rear end is now ordering a different cord, AGAIN!Do I have anything positive to say about this cord? Sure, I really like how long it is, and the material it’s made of is both flexible and feels well reinforced so I’m not worried it gets nicked easily. I can get that from other cords that don’t turn my phone into a parrot you just offended.Once more, I don’t really care to get a refund or anything. It was just $10. However, I would really appreciate it if Amazon stopped putting this listing first thing in front of me when I search for a long lightning charging cord. Mark my words, numb-nuts right here will be doing the exact same thing a year from now otherwise, wasting another $10.
