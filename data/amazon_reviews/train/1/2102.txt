The cord is durable and charges my phone quite quickly and I like the length HOWEVER (and this is a huge HOWEVER), it is a dangerous product and could possibly cause a fire if say it was touching your carpet OR dangled off from the desk into a nearby trashcan (the cord length is indeed long enough to reach say a trashcan or the carpet from a desk or countertop). DO NOT BUY. Attached is a picture of one of two burns I got from this on my right forearm. For a couple of months now I'd be on my computer and feel an occasional sharp sting on my right forearm/ wrist area and would always find the USB tip portion of the cord touching that part of my skin. At first I thought it was just in my mind that there's no way electricity could be that strong coming through the cable BUT it was! The "cut" I had on my arm was very odd. There wasn't much blood and the skin looked rotted (not cut) and there was some fluid. I could not find out what had happened to my arm (thought it was a fungal infection?) but now I am sure because I felt a sting again today and it was right next to my other wound. Please be very careful and I would suggest not to buy this product.
