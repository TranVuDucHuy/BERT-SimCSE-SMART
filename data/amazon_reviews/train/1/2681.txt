The microphone does not work and seems inferior to the rest of the kit. It is also by a different brand.The cables shown are also different especially the one from the microphone to lighting (iOS devices). When I contacted the company they said the kit is complete, which is true, because you have to plug in an extension to get the microphone or iOS.There is no light or indicator on the microphone or you cannot tell if it’s on or not. There is also no switch to turn it on/off.I contacted Movo and after back and forth trouble shooting for a few days , they said to return it to Amazon and reorder a new kit.The ease of setup was definitely a plus, and will look for similar kits in the future, but I don’t think I will go with this company.After receiving the kit, it is definitely not worth the price. A short desktop tripod, light and microphone is not worth $100.
