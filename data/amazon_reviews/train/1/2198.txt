I just bought this over the weekend because of the "great" reviews. I've had it in my hands for less than 1 day and decided to return it. The packaging exterior was obviously re-purposed. Old barcode labels were still on. There was obvious damage to the box from removal of a prior shipping label. There were layers of packing tape around the edges - original ones were circles...both types were on there.Inside, there was one small bag...barely big enough to cover the mic. However, that bag wasn't even on anything. It was crumpled up under the device.It was painfully obvious that this was a return/refurb - but that was never disclosed. But what the heck, I tried it. Had extreme difficulty getting the screen to stay in place. It's flex arm is extremely flimsy. The stand isn't really a stand. It's more like a hole with 2 rubberbands to hold it in place.Once I finally had it connected and set-up, it could barely pick up my voice from inches away.Save yourself the time. Pay attention to the negative review. Go somewhere else.
