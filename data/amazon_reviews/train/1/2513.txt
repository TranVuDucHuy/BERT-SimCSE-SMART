“Push once, twice or three times on L. or R. earbud for volume, phone, sound variations, advance song, replay current song.” You get so mixed up with how many times you push the earbud button and on which side you need to, to change something. Called support, texted also, because the sound would go out on one of the buds. Come to find out it wasn’t charging in the case. They will not take them back because I bought them thru Amazon. The date to return them has now expired. 😔😔😔
