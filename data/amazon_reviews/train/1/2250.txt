I love this headset. I've used it all day, every day for the past six month. Recently, I started having issues with it so I decided to send it in for warranty replacement. When checked on the status of my replacement, I was told it was backordered with no estimate as to when it will be back in stock. Now I am without a headset, indefinitely. This is a great headset, but if you have problems with it you're better off throwing it in the garbage and buying a new one. They're support is some of the worst you'll ever experience and not worth the headache and frustration. Not sure if I'm going the wait for the replacement, but the same thing new, or try something different. Thanks for ruining Plantronics, Polycom (aka Poly).Update, 3/30/2022Poly's support is worse than previously noted. Additionally, the new headset has the same issues as the first one that I returned. I can only conclude that there are inherent issues with this headset. It's a decent headset, even with the issues, but it's not worth $100-120. I would not but this again. Look elsewhere for a quality product that offers support.
