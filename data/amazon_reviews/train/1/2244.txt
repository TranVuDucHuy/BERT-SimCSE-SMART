Loved my old voyager earpiece but it was starting to fail after 3 years of constant hard use. Got super excited about the ability to switch between cell phone and voip conference calls and bit the bullet for a shiny new 5200. Bottom line is after 4 months I prefer my taped up voyager BY FAR! Cool features and capabilities make for great marketing but when your new earpiece effectively stops working after 4 months they don’t mean much. First thing to go was the multi connectivity…that lasted about a month but I figured maybe I’m too out of touch with technology to figure it out and kept rolling. Then the battery life started to go but hey who really needs all that talk time when you have a handy dandy charge base to se it in….hmmm well that stopped working soon after. Now I’m lucky if I get 4 hours out of it and then the killer…the microphone stopped working. Now I have a glorified single earbud that is only good for listening to audible books. On the bright side the old voyager is still kicking and I’m learning new and creative ways to tape up the cracks in the flexible housing that goes over my ear. For anyone interested don’t use electrical tape. Got this weird rash on my ear. So GROSS! The magical substance that is holding them together now without creating a need for antibiotics…wait for it… Tegaderm! Ugh…I’m turning into my father. The man stapled up tears in his favorite shorts for years. In all seriousness my experience with the 5200 was so disappointing I’m now hesitant to buy a different Plantronics earpiece. I fear the team that built the simple durable legend I still love is probably gone and some new crew is trying to pack more feature “bling” into a new disimproved earpiece to drive more sales. They sell tegaderm in 6 foot rolls though so I have some time to decide.
