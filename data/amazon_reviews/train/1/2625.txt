I bought two of these for a upcoming trip to Africa (I also had 4 others of 2 different brands) Having used SanDisk before, I had no qualms about buying these for their intended purpose. Upon arriving home a month later I pulled them out of the protective carrying case I was using and checked them one by one. At first, everything was fine, all pictures appeared in the folder, so I moved on to going through all my cards, editing and sorting.After I went through 3 cards, I put the first SanDisk card in, and the folder came up showing that it was empty. Tried a couple more times to no avail, so I tried different devices; laptop, tablet, camera, all showing empty. Back in the PC, I now had a new window saying that the card needed to be formatted.It's a good thing I know what I'm doing when it comes to issues like this, and was able to recover the photos on the card, and transfer to a hard drive, just a massive PITA. But for anyone who doesn't know how to do that, they will feel that they just lost a ton of pictures, and crying and gnashing of teeth would ensue.So buyer beware, these things aren't perfect.
