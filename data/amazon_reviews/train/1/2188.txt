I got these mainly to charge my Samsung Galaxy s21 Ultra.When I plugged my phone in, it would repeatedly bring up the charging notification - as though I just plugged it in every few seconds. I thought this was the USB cables I was using, but when I took the same cables and plugged them into the charger that came with my phone, the phone charged smoothly.This happened with all four chargers. I will not be plugging my devices into these.Although this is better than the last cheapo charger I bought (which started smoking and fried my phone), it's not really good. I should have learned my lesson - don't cheap out on chargers!
