I’m starting to not trust Amazon because this product had great reviews but I’ve purchased more than 2 sets for our business and all microphones are unreliable. Out of each set one has gone bad - completely unreliable, spotty audio with bad sound quality. It’s so frustrating to deal with crappy “five star” products especially when you depend on this for work. I reached out to Tonor to replace one bad microphone and they just told me to reset it which did not solve any issues. I recommend going for better a quality product.
