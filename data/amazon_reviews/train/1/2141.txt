This was exactly what I wanted. Charged it up out the box. Took it to work and sounded great. Went to recharge and nothing. Charging light comes on, stays on while charging and it won't turn back on. So $64 for a day of music. Piece of fn junk! JBL on the way. Pop for the extra $40 and get you a brand name speaker.
