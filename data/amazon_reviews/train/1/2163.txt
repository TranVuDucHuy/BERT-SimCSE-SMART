There isn't enough clearance on the item for the phone cable to be plugged in while the phone is in a vertical position. The only way for the charging cable to fit is if the phone is tilted 30+ degrees, meaning anyone you're on a call with will just be staring up your nose or at the ceiling in the background. The item itself doesn't allow for telescoping vertically, so what you see is what you get in terms of height.
