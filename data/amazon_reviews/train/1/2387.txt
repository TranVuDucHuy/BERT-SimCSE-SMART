Based on the reviews, had good expectations on this system as a mobile DJ. Bought the 1st set and one mic would not power on despite all attempts, new batteries, etc. Returned and got a 2nd set. Both mics powered on, but the receiver would not fix on a frequency and the digital readout would just keep spinning. Had to return the 2nd set, now looking for another set brand. Guess I got two different “lemons”?
