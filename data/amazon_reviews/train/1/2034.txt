Not the right clip to fit my needs. You would think the two sets of prongs would make it sturdy but it doesn't. My phone still moved around and was wobbly, which defeats the purpose of have a sturdy mount for safety reasons. Returned this one and purchased Qifutan brand phone mount that best suited what I wanted in a phone mount.
