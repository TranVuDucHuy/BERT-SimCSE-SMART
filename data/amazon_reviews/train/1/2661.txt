First off, it took 10 days to receive this item on Prime shipping. Not acceptable but here we are. The 3M adhesive for the base mount was laughably not sticky. The entire reason I purchased the item was for this feature and it was a bust. The clamp for the vent holder is actually really well designed if that is something that you as a buyer want.
