Beeps loud on its own every day when you move it. So if you have it on keys…wallet…it drives you mad as in really mad hearing it beep at you for 15 seconds, especialy when you are in places where it is supposed to be quiet…like waking up and irritating others that sleep, when you hit the quiet hallways it announces you to entire world every day you steped out of your appartment…ah, and then it will randomly pop up on your phone when you jog that a tracker is nearby, as if i am stalking myself lol apple tech idiots. Needless to say once who want to quiet it for sinister uses can always do it. Essentialy, great product, but ruined for all practical uses it actualy could do well. Like find your keys, wallet, car, whatever. Wait and buy different producer that whose designers are not as stupid as to think random beeping every day solves anything.
