I’m not one to write reviews typically. But I felt really disappointed with this product so I don’t want others walking in with false expectations. To me this product is supposed to hold my phone and charge it. It hold my phone in place very well, it sturdy, and sleek. My issue is with the charging. It’s very inconsistent. When my phone is on there it charges for a second then stops. At first I thought it was my car, but I tried three different ports. Then I tried using a new car attachment. That did not work, leading me to conclude that it’s the charger itself. The reason for its bad review is you can’t give a good review for something only doing half the job.
