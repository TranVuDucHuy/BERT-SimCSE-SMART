I was looking for a pen to use with my new smartphone Galaxy Z folde3 5G.When I unboxed the pen and tried to use it, to my surprise, it was not working on my front screen.After I looked on YouTube I discovered that S Pen didn't work with the front screen, just with the inside screen (smartphone open) but, I saw neither on the Samsung website nor on Amazon talking about the non-working of the pen on the front screen.I was very disappointed and simply used the pen for 15 minutes which was enough to make the return of the pen. I received it and returned it on the same day.The storage case is very tight and the removal of the pen from it is somewhat complicated, unless you have a protective cover already with a compartment for it (the original cover offers) you will have to carry it separately to facilitate the loss.There are other options that are much cheaper and work better than this pen.I was very disappointed.
