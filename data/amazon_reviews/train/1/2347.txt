I have had these ear buds for about two months. They have been used about 12 times. During a call the person I was speaking with suddenly could not hear me. We tried to hang up and reconnect but they still were unable to hear me. The same thing happened again today.These ear buds were inexpensive but even so the have a one year warranty (it is not possible to initiate a warranty return since Panasonic will not process a warranty claim without the serial number (good luck trying to find one on these)).$15 dollars down the drain.
