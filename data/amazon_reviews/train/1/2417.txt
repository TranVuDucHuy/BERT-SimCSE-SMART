The external 5TB drive I ordered with this cable came packaged with a 12" cable. I bought this Amazon Essentials cable so I could plug the drive into a USB port at the back of my PC and still be able to have the drive visible to check activity and easy removal. I set up the cable/drive and never disturbed it again. Just this month (July) the drive began to silently save corrupt files and then failed to permit searches. I lost dozen of important files over a months time.I proceeded to trouble shoot by swapping to different USB ports on my PC and the drive only resumed to function normally only after I replaced this cable with the originally packaged drive cable.I have cables that are 15+ years old that still work just fine. To have a cable fail, undisturbed in less than a year, speaks to the quality of manufacturing and design. This Amazon Essential cable brand failed miserably.This is the kind of merchandizing that drove buyers from Sears which scrapped the bottom of the supply chain to maximize its profit margins at the expense of customer satisfaction and product quality. The 30 return policy speaks volumes that Amazon doesn't stand behind low risk low priced products.
