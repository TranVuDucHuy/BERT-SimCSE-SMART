This is the second unit I ordered within a week. Both sounded like they had loose parts on the inside, and neither would turn on.A giant waste of time and money. The seller is holding my money until they receive the unit (I’ve already shipped it back).I ended up going to a local office supply, and getting one I could test in the store. Don’t trust buying this one online. Especially since you have to wait for the refund.
