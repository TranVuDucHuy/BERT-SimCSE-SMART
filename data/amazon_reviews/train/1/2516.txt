I’ve heard raycons were great, but the right ear bud got real quiet for some reason. The left one still works abba I could still just barely hear the right one even when the volume is all the way up, but I just got them maybe a month ago. Now they have headphones called “cre8 sounds” (not on Amazon though) and those are almost completely waterproof and sound amazing. With how much you have to pay for raycons, they should last longer. The cre8 sounds headphones are a bit cheaper and I personally think better. They also have a better water protection rating.Edit: I just returned my second pair. The second pair was a replacement for the first one. So after this, I’m going for the cre8 sounds next. Do not recommend unless you want to spend 130 bucks on complete trash
