I bought 3 of these speakers for use in my coffee shop. I originally bought 2, but one was acting up so I thought it might be defective, and bought a 3rd just to have backup. All 3 of them didn't last 6 months. I thought it may be the batteries, so I actually bought 3 batteries at $20 each and paid a tech guy to install them for me. Guess what? The speakers still don't work. Won't hold a charge, if it will even turn on at all. Now I'm out about $720 all together and had to go back to using a radio in my coffee shop. Very unhappy with this garbage. Was ecstatic at first with sound quality, the ability to hook up multiple speakers, but it was short lived. Customers did not touch these speakers. We kept them away from their reach. This was due to normal usage. Would not recommend unless you don't care about longevity and don't mind lighting money on fire.
