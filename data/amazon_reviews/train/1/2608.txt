I am so disappointed in this. Bought it for my elderly mother to use at her card games at the Senior Center, as the leader often can't be heard over all the talking. Had it several weeks before she was able to try it due to Covid in the leader, etc but when she tried it the voice will only project about 3 feet! Have tried contacting Customer Service several times but no reply. Do not waste your money.
