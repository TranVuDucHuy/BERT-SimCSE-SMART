HORRIBLE PRODUCT! Two reasons you buy this product. 1. to magnetically hold you phone & 2 to give you a charged battery. I very rarely if ever write reviews but I felt the need on this one because its absolutely the most garbage charger I've ever seen or used. The packaging and feel of this is absolutely a quality product but it literally doesn't do the two things you need it to do. Holy your phone, and give you a charge. Does NOT charge my phone unless it within millimeters of the right spot... furthermore forget if you have a phone case or a magnet on the back to hold the phone to the magnet on the charger.! it won't charge through the case or the magnet (if you can even call it that) won't hold the phone even remotely on the slightest angle much less in a moving car. WOW! secondly it won't charge consistently when placed directly on the spot its supposed to charge on. RETURNING IMMEDIATELY.
