Ive been buying these earbuds for years, probably gone through 10+. This time and the last time i bought them the quality has gone down. The lifespan has decreased and this newest pair is cutting in and out when the wire moves right out of the box.I used to love these, they were solid cheap earbuds without a mic which I love. The 10$ earbuds from walmart are way better then these now.
