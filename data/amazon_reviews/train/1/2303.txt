Back in 2019-2020, got one for work, I needed to use it with a qualified SSD brand, my employer stated or requested to use. I wasn't aloud to install the SSD in my PC, it must be used externally and connect via USB.After connect the "brand new qualified OEM SSD" with this Adapter, my PC did successfully read the SSD but I was unable to install their OS. It kept failing or crashing during the installation process and/or failing the security requirements if the installation was completed. Call employer IT, applied numerous reboot, reinstall drivers and OS + all Troubleshooting you can imagine, my call was also escalated to highest Rep in their IT support department (after numerous transfers), after 4-5 hrs call with No Luck and never able to figure it out where the issue was, then just before we end the call.. I find out the root of the issue, it was in this adapter, I touched on and it was Extremely Hot. Purchase a different adapter and brand, that one was a USB 3.0 (not 3.1) and problem solved.The worst, the PC did read the SSD, but it didn't function as promoted, I lost time + all the troubleshooting and difficulties I went thru, to find out why or where the issue I was having, it's not worth it...I do not recommend this adapter, specially when you have a brand new one, your PC may read your diver and still, it will not function as you expect, it tells me this Brand QA, it's close to zero or none.This review may seems harsh, what I can say is: Amazon did offer me a refund and was told; it's cheaper to refund and to toss away the adapter, instead of doing the return process.Again, it means this Company -> StarTech.com must be cutting corners in some areas by saving $ in parts/chips, so they can have good profits, therefore QA being affected by.
