This wall outlet expander is USED! And it came straight from the factory as ADDtam US is the seller and the product name is ADDtam. The package was not sealed nor does the product smell like new electronics smell. I have purchased plenty of electronics from allover the place. This item has no small and it is dirty. The plastic tray also has a brown stain on it and dirt on top where items can be placed. There are light scratches by the usb ports and power outlet plugs. Why did I pay for a new one and got a Used one? Also the package did not have any piece of paper like a warranty statement or description like all new products have. I'm getting tired of buying Asian made poop. Look at the pictures and see the specks of dirt and scratches on the plug holes. Look at all the pictures and you will see the signs of use especially the second picture where the slot is to pull a cable through and have the tray hold it. It's brown and dirty!
