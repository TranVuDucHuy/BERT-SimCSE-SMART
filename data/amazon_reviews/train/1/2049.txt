The most impressive thing about these cables is that with how poorly they perform someone still thought it was a good idea to sell them.They don’t make a solid connection with any device. On either end. If you’re just looking to charge a phone on a table and not touch it at all until it’s fully charged. You’ll be fine. But if for instance you’re looking to play music in your car through USB. Even just touching the screen on your phone to goto the next song will break the connection. I’ve never found a cable as low quality as these.
