So disappointing. First, there is no where to store this pen in the phone and no notification if the pen ventures to far from the phone. It is a sure way to loose the pen. Also there aren't any real features with this pen. You can click the button to open the menu (after you take time to find the button every time you want to use it) but the pen must be almost touching the screen to do so. It is simply easier and quicker to just tap the icon. Other than that, no other features. You can't even use it to snap photos from a distance. It also can't be used on the front screen. Handwriting on the phone is certainly easier to do with this pen, but you can do that with a regular stylus. And just like a regular stylus, you can loose it because you don't have anywhere to store it. I would say that this is nothing more than just a regular stylus, however, a regular stylus has one advantage over this pen... you can use the stylus on the front screen! If you are looking for something with true s pen features I suggest you dish out the $100 for the s pen pro (which is almost what an s pen is supposed to be but still lacks proper storage) otherwise I suggest you save the money and buy a cheap 10 pack of stylus for $5 so you have extra for when you loose them.
