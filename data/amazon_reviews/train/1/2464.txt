Multiple failures on this unit almost simultaneously -- never beat on it, never got it wet, dropped, nothing, rarely even played loud. First: speakers are crackling like crazy - did quick internet search and appears to be a known problem that glue (get that, "glue") used to fix speakers in frames loosens and speakers vibrate and crackle, big time. Second: at about the same time, battery life completely died.Called JBL -- totally useless customer service -- guy said four years is pretty good, which is nonsense. Could understand maybe battery loosing recharge capacity after awhile, but speaker failure is major design flaw. JBL will take no responsibility for this.They did offer to give me a 10% credit on a new unit.Too bad, frankly, not sure what to do now -- did a lot of research, including ordered and returned many units (Amazon Prime...) before found this unit which was by far the best sound/volume quality in price range.Just craps out and is a throw away after 4 years.FURTHER NOTE: the "common" failure method that appears on various youtube "fix-it" videos is that either the glue holding the speaker in the frame or the glue holding the magnet on the speaker back has come loose. Not the case for me: the speaker is totally blown.Inexcusable after 4 years of light use and pampering.Otherwise, these are (were...) great units
