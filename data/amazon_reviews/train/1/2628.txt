I was waiting for my SD Memory Card on 12/17, but I just receive it, besides SD memory card and digital camera are not working, when I insert the SD memory card into the camera, I read a message saying: 'memory is full, insert another SD memory card to transfer and take more photos', what does that mean?, the lens never go out or in other words, never moves, and I feel very frustrated besides that I'm thinking that I lost my money for nothing or I bought just garbage, but can you guys help me somehow please? because I don't know what to do about this issue, anyway...God bless you guys, Maranatha: Jesus coming soon
