These seemed great for the price. However, if you're not careful, you're going to lose your air tag. First off, the snaps are always coming undone. One of the holders completely broke off the key chain after limited use. Tracked the AirTag back to a homeless man who denied he had it despite proof on the tracking. I won't be buying these again and if I could I'd return them.
