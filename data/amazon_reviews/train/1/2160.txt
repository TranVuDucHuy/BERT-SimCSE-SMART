Edit 2 - 7 months on and I definitely regret the purchase. The slightest movement causes the buds to come dislodged. If you are exercising, doing dishes, or have messy hands, then you will get your headphones messy and have to stop to clean or stick them back in your ear messy. The headphones are just ok because of this and the price is not justified.Edit - 5 months on, I think I regret this purchase. For the price, they should not fall out so easily when doing things like washing dishes or mowing. These do not hook into your ear like airpods.Noise cancellation is pretty good. They do fall out pretty easily. Will try other tips but shape is not as ergonomic as AirPods. Case is nicer than my wifeâ€™s set which was twice as expensive. Hers do fit better.
