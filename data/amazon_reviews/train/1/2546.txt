I started using these headphones back in January 2022. In the last few weeks (September 2022), the cord covers on both sides have started to crumble. One side has a chunks missing, the other side has a hairline crack that I can only expect to get worse. I have never stretched them out, only pulled the ears apart wide enough to put the headphones on.
