I wanted a bulk pack of chargers because they’re the one thing that always seem to go missing. I put one in my car, one in my purse, one on both sides of my bed, and one in my living room. I’ve had them for a little over 2 weeks now and 3/6 are broken. One literally does not charge anymore and the others are breaking at the joint by the charging port. The charging power was slow from the beginning even with a bigger charger plugin. Kinda sad.. I personally wouldn’t buy this brand again.
