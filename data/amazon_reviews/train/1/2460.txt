I tried charging it with several other USB-C to USB-C cables that I use for tablet's, phones, remotes and all of my other devices and it will not charge. It only charges with the USB-C to USB-A cable that came in the box. A cable with a USB-A end cannot charge devices as fast. I am not interested in having another cable plugged in just for this one device. Returned.
