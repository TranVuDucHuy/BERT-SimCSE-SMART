Search the web and YouTube for "road wireless go to receiver power button not working" and you'll see the issue I had. Seems pretty common. And this seller might just be reselling the broke/fixed ones, judging by fact mine came looking used (tarnished screen covers), or if they were new from factory, then Rode has some real QC issues.I took video opening it like I always do on Amazon purchases, and this unit was shipped in a reused Lego box (for the outside box)... No kidding!!!Mine failed the day of a wedding, to boot.... But I did notice the power button being flakey the couple days before... I should have ignored my inner optimist.
