Not happy with these earbuds. They keep disconnecting from my phons. Also if you have them in the charging box and you have them in the car with you close to your phone they will automatically connect to your Bluetooth cellphone and you won't be able to know what is going on if somone calls you unless you figure it out the earbuds got connected to your phone Bluetooth automatically although the earbuds are inside the charging box and your phone is connected to the vehicle's Bluetooth you still won't be able to hear the person who called you unless you turn off the Bluetooth on your actual phone and you make sure the earbuds are no longer connected to your phone, i find it very annoying that I have to turn off my phone Bluetooth every time someone calls me while i am driving and i won't be able to hear the person cause of the earbuds decided to connect to my phone although they are charing inside the chargin box. I keep reseting them to see if they keep staying connected to my phone but they won't. I had it enough, if i can return them and get my refund I would. Stay away from this brand and spend your money on a better brand. I tried to save some money thinking that these earbuds are going to work good but they suck.
