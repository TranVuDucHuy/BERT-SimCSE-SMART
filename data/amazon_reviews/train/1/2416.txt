I normally don't buy the least expensive cables since, over time, this has not served me well. However, after reading the many positive reviews, I decided that I would only lose $6 if this cable were not of good quality, which it isn't.Ironically, I purchased this cable to replace a Toshiba Canvio 1TB USB 3.0 drive that came with a cable that has the exact same design/manufacturing flaw (right out of the box) that this Amazon Basics cable has; the USB "A" connector does NOT fit properly into any USB ports. If you accidentally move the laptop/drive while using this cable, the power is immediately cut off. It's very easy to corrupt the Master File Table for the drive (and thereby orphan all of the data on said drive) when this happens.I have at total of 5 external USB drives, some are 2.0 some are 3.0, and none of them have this problem. Not one of them. I can plug them into any of the USB ports on any of my many machines without issue. However, that cannot be said of the faulty Toshiba Canvio cable, nor the Amazon Basics 3.0 USB A to USB micro B cable.Many of you may find this same issue reported by other purchasers from places other than Amazon too. In other words, this is a common problem across "different manufacturers", which leads me to believe that this cable is actually made by the same Chinese company that makes most of the USB 3.0 cables similar to this one.Having said that, it's not the 6 bucks that I'm unhappy about, it's the fact that American consumers are being taken, on so many levels, by American companies doing business with low-quality Chinese manufacturers, and Amazon should be concerned about what is being delivered to their customers. I just wanted to add my comments to those that already feel this way, because this topic matters. I'd pay a little bit more for a cable/product that is engineered/made properly by a company that actually has adequate Engineering and QA Departments.
