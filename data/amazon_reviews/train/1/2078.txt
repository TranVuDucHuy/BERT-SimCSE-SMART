I placed an order via amazon for Brother Printer DR 630 Drum Unit on 8/30/2016. The Drum Unit was sold by RMR Pacific. The unit is not compatible with the Brother printer because when installed the printer started making load humming noise and clicking noise upon printing. I need to order a Drum unit that is compatible with the Brother printer. Please advise how this should be handled? Certainly we do not want to pay again for a new Drum Unit and need to know how to order via Amazon a genuine Brother Unit to avoid getting the printer damaged. Please advise, Thank you.
