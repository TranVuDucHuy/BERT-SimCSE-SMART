I don't always write reviews, but when I do it's because I became frustrated.I have a JBL Flip 4 speaker that I use as my computer speaker for my work laptop (I work from home since March) and my home desktop. I got tired of removing one audio cable and plugging in the other, so I bought this splitter. It worked like a champ for the first two weeks. But for the last 2 days, the speaker started to hiss when it wasn't being used and when it is being used, the audio quality is very scratchy. I have stopped using the splitter and gone back to plugging and unplugging wires like before. The speakers sounds fine now, no hissing too. So it's the splitter that caused the problem.
