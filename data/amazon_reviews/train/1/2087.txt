I missed the return window on 12 September 2022, and now I have to keep these broken headphones that has a screeching sound and it doesn’t block out sound along with the plug being bent and falling apart. Not good at all. I do not recommend and if you’ve already bought this RETURN THEM, they’ll eventually fall apart on you in a few days. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GETTING THESE
