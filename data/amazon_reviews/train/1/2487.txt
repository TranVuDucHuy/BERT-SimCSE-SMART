I wore these for a few hours and now theyâ€™re going in the trash. One ear pad fell off in the case. I replaced the pads with another size, and one fell off in my ear.The volume controls are terrible; you have to press really hard on the earbud, so you basically have to hold it with one hand while pressing the button with the other.
