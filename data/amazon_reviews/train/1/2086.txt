I bought two pair at the same time, one for grand son, another for grand daughter. My grand son's stop working with minimal use. They use them when coming to visit every other weekend for a few hours. I looked online to see about returning to get another pair and the message says I couldn't because it's past August 15. Very disappointing, only got a few months use from them.
