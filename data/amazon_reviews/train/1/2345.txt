EDIT: These worked for less than 1 day. I tried them out right after they arrived, the sound good and they were very comfortable to wear. I watched half of a movie on my laptop, switched them to my MP3 and walked 3 miles, did a little stretching then put them on my dresser...the next morning I started my MP3 and the sound in the left ear kept going in and out, I checked to make sure the jack was plugged in all the way and as soon as I touched it the sound came back but when I let go it went out in the left ear again. I'm an adult, not hard on the things I have (I've had the same Sony MP3 player for 4 years and it's going strong) and I know better than to pull on the cord when removing the buds from my ears so obviously I'm not impressed with the durability will be asking Amazon for a refund.YAY! Finally a pair of earbuds that don't hurt my ears... Not sure why it is, maybe I have small ears, but I frequently have problems with earbuds hurting after wearing them for only a minute or two. I haven't had any problem with these hurting even when wearing the for long periods of time, in fact they are really comfortable, and so far they are staying put in my ears when I'm doing busy with more energetic activities (think biking, yoga, vacuuming, race walking, etc.). Sound is good (although I'm no audiophile), clear without any undesirable static noises and the bass sounds good to me. I can't speak for their ability to stand up to daily use as I haven't had them long, but if they fail I'll come back with an update. I gave them 4 stars because they are so far as expected and haven't disappointed me. I rarely give 5 stars, only if something performs well above and beyond expectations so a 4 star rating is high in my book.
