I used these earbuds about twice a week for 3 months. I always put them back in the case, I never dropped them or got them wet. One day, the sound in the right ear bud just completely stopped working. The left earbud worked fine. Amazon only has a 30 day return policy, and I trusted Anker products, so I didn't think I needed to purchase the 2 year protection. I am just very disappointed.
