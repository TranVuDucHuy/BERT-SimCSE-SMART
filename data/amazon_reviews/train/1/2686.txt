What a joy it is so work hard on a video that you only have one shot at to find their is absolutely no audio or just static. I could not be more irate. I work with animals and this mic only works about 50% of the time. And you don’t know until you go and play the video back! I can’t redo the shots I missed, they are just gone forever and now my business takes a huge hit and waste of time. DO NOT GET. Worthless.
