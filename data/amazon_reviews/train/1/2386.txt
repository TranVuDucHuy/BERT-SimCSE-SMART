This microphone WAS and sounded excellent until it stop working after our 4th karaoke party . Only one microphone works for some reason . The microphones were never dropped or even put down hard . I was looking to buy another set but after the microphone stopped working, I will look elsewhere. If it wasn't for that, I would have given this Toner microphone 10 stars, if the rating went that high.
