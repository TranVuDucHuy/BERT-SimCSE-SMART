Bought 6. First 2 out of the box reported a nearly dead battery. Brand new, and were previously unopened. If you look online you'll find post after post about this happening with these things. People even change batteries out and they still show low battery life. Defective.Then after adding these near death trackers to the Samsung Smartthings app (mess) and going into the find>locate on map view link, a popup shows up that says I need to acknowledge the "find use of location information" updated terms. Choices are cancel or agree. Cancel kicks you out of the map view (making these useless) and agree just closes and relaunches the same location terms update message. It's a never ending loop. So you can't view updated information about the location of your tags. Dumb.This might be the worst product I've bought in several years. As an android S21 Ultra user, I had high hopes. I returned them all and bought Tile Pro instead. Stay away from these and the mess that is the Smartthings app.
