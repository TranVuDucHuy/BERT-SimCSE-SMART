I have owned 6 Brother label printers and with time they became better, more features and easier to use until the one is now being reviewed. The last printer I had to discard, the "on" button was malfunction and it was not worth taking the printer to be repaired: would cost more than a new one.So I ordered what I thought was the "top of the line" Brother printer: this PT-D600 is a nightmare to use, a nightmare to read through the instructions, a nightmare to get through to Brother customer service for support: 80 minutes on hold until a technician took the call, 25 minutes on line to get web support (useless). Finally with the technician, even though one is asked for the product number to be directed to a "specialist", this poor technician was learning "in the job": had no clue how the machine worked.When we finally figured out some of the features of the machine, many of the features part of my older machine were not available such as:when the machine is switched off, all of the settings go into default mode, therefore one has to set again the font, the style, the size . at every use."Caps" also has to be set at each use because default mode is small caps.I wish I could return this machine, I wasted half a day trying to familiarize myself with it but no luck. I am tempted to discard it, it is so user unfriendly.
