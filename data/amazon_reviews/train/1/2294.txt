This is the perfect label printer if you are a Windows user, not so much for Mac users. I gave a low rating because the listing makes it seem like there's no difference.There are 2 software packages. One is to create labels, and print them when printer is attached via USB. The other is to transfer label files between computer and printer. The second one is only available for Windows.What does this mean? It means that Mac users can't move Mac-saved files to the printer and can't move printer-saved files to the Mac. Essentially, whichever environment the labels were created in are locked in that location. Not to mention, the templates on the printer do not allow changing the cutting prefs, so if you use them, you will be losing a lot of 1 inch blanks (as complained about elsewhere).As someone who mostly uses the printer by itself, only connecting the Mac so that I could create a label that I'll need going forward, this has less than half functionality.
