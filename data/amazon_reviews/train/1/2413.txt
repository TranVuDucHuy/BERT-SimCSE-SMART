I had purchased a replacement cord for my Seagate 1Tb external hard drive, and this cord was suggested in the buying options. The reviews were good so I purchased; however it does not work with my hard drive. I guess I'll have to try another brand. The cord itself is pretty heavy duty and has a really good length to it. If it works for your device then it would probably be a good buy.
