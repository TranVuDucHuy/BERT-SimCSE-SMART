but it’s not USB 3.1 (10Gbps) as advertisedChecking the Cable it says 3.0 so in other words it’s (5Gbps)And checking the PC it also register as a 3.0 DeviceAnd my PC supports thunderbolt/USB4 & USB 3.1So the bottom line,it’s False Advertising kind of !!!.plus the Change of the USB Naming is confusing already a few years ago lol.I’m not gonna return it because I need it. and I don't believe I'm gonna get any faster then the SATA 3interface which is 600MB/sBut it’s very sad that they advertise it like that that’s a big difference in Speed from 10Gbps to only getting 5GbpsEverywhere else the Cable the Box the instructions paper & Amazon product name says USB 3.1 (10Gbps) !!but you will still be Limited by the SATA 6Gb/s of the SATA drive anywayit's not like you gonna get an SSD to go Faster then the SATA 3 Interfaceso don't get discourage on buying it it's just a warningit's still a great brand and good performance.------------ Update after 3 Days of usage it Died on me :( -----------it worked so well then it just died on meI did not expect it to die so quickly
