Was working great and then it suddenly stopped working after only using it for 3 months. And I canâ€™t return it or exchange because the window is closed.Update 12/24/2020The seller reached out to me and offered to give me a refund or a new adapter. I chose a refund because I had already purchased another adapter from Target. I'm still leaving one star for the product itself because it broke after such a short amount of time. Also, I wanted to note that the seller emailed me 2-3 times asking me to change this review or "make it disappear" because it is important to his customer service adding a :( at the end of each message... It may just be me but it came off extremely weird.
