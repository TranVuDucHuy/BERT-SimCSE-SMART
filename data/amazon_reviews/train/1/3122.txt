This was supposed to be a gift to me from my wife but I had to open it early and see if it was damaged due to the box arriving completely destroyed.I have been using SanDisk SD and Micro SD cards exclusively as a photographer without any problems. But this should have been tested and put in a new box..For the price of this card this is unacceptable. Because the missing pieces of the package were not inside the box I know it was shipped like that..I may need to re-evaluate the brand I use for my photography business and recommend to othersPlease note: the card works but I am displeased at the condition they shipped it in. So be careful if you consider buying from this seller
