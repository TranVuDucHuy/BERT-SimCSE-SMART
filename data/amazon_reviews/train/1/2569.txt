I just received the T12 earbuds to be an upgrade of my T10's. I'm not entirely sure they are an upgrade. I really like my T10's and have had zero issues with them...these T12's are turning out to be an absolutely horrible experience.First of all they are larger and heavier and that's not a good thing. The extra weight is a little uncomfortable to say the least.Second, the tap feature to control video pause feature is extremely sensitive and I find myself pausing and unpausing videos when simply trying to adjust the earbuds in my ears. The worst part of this is when I set them down on my desk, the volume slider moves on its own because it thinks I'm trying to change it...and it is unpausing the video! I don't even understand how this is possible. This could result in hearing damage if someone unknowingly had the volume change and goes to resume a video.Third is the quality of material of the rubber caps is extremely thin and weak feeling. Compared the the rubber caps I got with the T10's, they are an absolute downgrade and really difficult to swap out...this makes them feel like the earbuds themselves are always going to fall out of my ears...leading back to my second issue of the tap controls being too sensitive and registering feedback when I'm trying to make sure they aren't falling out.I seriously think this is a failed model. The only positive seeing is the digital battery meter in the case. Too bad TOZO customer service doesn't give a @#$&...I wanted to be able to support them.
