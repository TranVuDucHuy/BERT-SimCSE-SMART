I bought this in April when we went virtual. I may have printed 50 pages and my printer started showing a no toner message. So I took it out to use my back up with the hopes of it working. No such luck! Stayed on hold for an hour with customer service and they told me my warranty was voided because I used knock off ink but I told them I threw away the good stuff because of a faulty message. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager finally called me back at 6:30 pm when I wasn’t anywhere near the printer. I haven’t heard back from them. PITIFUL customer service. I’ll never use brother again.
