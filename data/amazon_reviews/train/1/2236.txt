I bought it two months ago on Amazon on Aug 7, 2022 and haven't had a chance to use it until about a month ago. And after recording about 40min, I noticed that the Rx was off and I thought it was just out of battery. So I tried to charged it fully and the battery icon showed full. Then about two weeks ago, I got another chance to try it and this time, the Rx module just shut down randomly and even when I turned it back with the power button, the battery icon was full. Then I tried to charge it with 2 different chargers. Same issue, the Rx just shuts down randomly and also the screen stuck without response.I have spoken with Amazon and the seller, they are throwing me back and forth and asking me to return this after 20% fee... I am sure this thing has warrantee and it is for sure within 90 days.So I contact Rode customer service and after about a week, the agent came back with some cut and paste instructions... So end up with 80% money back to save my valuable time...
