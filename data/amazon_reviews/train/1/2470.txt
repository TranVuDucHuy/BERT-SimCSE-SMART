Wasn’t impressed with the sound at all. Seems sort of shallow and anemic. Plugged it in to pc to watch tv show and it varied from being too loud to being too hard to hear low voices and sounds. Wish i had a chance to hear them before i bought them. Don’t even use it. Was so unimpressed, decided to do surgery on my crappy speaker it was to replace to change the battery. I prefer my crappy frankenspeaker over this one. That being said, MAYBE with a decent software equalizer they would be a lot better? Can’t seem to get mine to work.
