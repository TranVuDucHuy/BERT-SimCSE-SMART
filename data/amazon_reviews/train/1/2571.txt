The item does not work. I bought an open Box and Amazon should stop selling it unless they factory wipe themselves. The item had someone's account info on it so it was locked to them. I could not connect to this because of that. It does run on coin battery. The battery is a bit hard to get to and need to be careful not to crack the frame when opening it. The item is fine but does not come with a key ring. The material on the surface is very scratch prone. I did test the battery and it was still fully charged but I do not know for sure how long I will last. You do need the Samsung application to connect. It is about the same size as an airbag but you do not have to buy a case to hang it on your Keychain. Overall I could not use the item as it was open Box. A bit annoying as the item should be at least factory wiped before hand. You can at least connect to your keys easier than airbag but I am not sure how effective it is.
