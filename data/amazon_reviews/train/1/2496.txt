I used this s pen one time when I first got it, kept it stored away til today to use again, and now it doesn't work! My phone doesn't even recognize its existence. It was bought brand new, not used, it's 2 months old and doesn't work. Unacceptable for the price and brand name. I cannot return it either. Very upsetting. Don't waste your time or money buying the brand name, get the off brand for cheaper. I Do not recommend this product. It's not easy to use because it doesn't work. It's not accurate because it doesn't work!
