When my guaranteed-by-Amazon-and-the-seller reconditioned computer failed, and the guarantee turned out to be worthless (there's a lesson there, people!), this cable was one of the things I tried to recover my data from the harddrive. It didn't work. I was unable to find any hard drive that, when connected to this cable, could be recognized by any of the computers I have access to.Good idea, but possible poor execution or QC. A waste of ~$13 and a few days waiting for the cable to arrived--small potatos compared to the money lost on the computer and the data lost, but still.
