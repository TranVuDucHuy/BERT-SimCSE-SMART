I used to like my Epson printer because I could use any offbrand cartridges but orfcourse the top Epson jerks decided they need more money over consumer experience. Now you can only use these incredibly expensive cartridges that don't even last long.The printer says I'm out of ink but still prints perfectly. Then out of nowhere it says it will not print until a new cartridge is inserted even though it was printing just fine. I'd prefer to let it run out of ink before replacing. This is corrupt late stage capitalism at it's worse.Learn from me, DO NOT BUY EPSON products.
