Their product overheated and broke my phone. Contacted them and they said to mail it to them so they can “investigate” and will pay for damages if at fault. OF COURSE. They weren’t at fault… although I went to professionals and did my own investigation before mailing off the product (and paid to ship it to Hong Kong!!) and they were most definitely at fault because it was their product that overheated. DONT BUY FROM ANKER!
