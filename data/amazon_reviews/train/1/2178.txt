The quality of the product is very good. In fact, I’ve purchased this twice but I won’t be doing it again. Everything worked great until the hot summer. The sun on the windshield caused the sticky gel to become viscous. It ran down my windshield and dropped onto my dashboard. It made a sticky, gooey, almost impossible to remove, mess. I had to get Goo Gone, razor blades, etc. to remove the runny adhesive. It took hours, lots of effort, and still left drip stains on my new dashboard. Figure out how to prevent this and then it’s a 5 star product. Until then, after the mess, it’s sadly a single star!
