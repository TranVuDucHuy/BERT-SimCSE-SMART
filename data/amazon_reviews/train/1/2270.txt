This was my first professional microphone purchase. After doing tons of research and talking to two friends that are in the recording industry I decided to go with an XLR mic and this one because of reviews and recommendations.After ordering and getting the Mic I was unable to get it to work using an M-Audio audio interface which I assumed was probably a driver or firmware issue. After spending a week updating/downgrading drivers and motherboard firmware on my Windows 7 64bit computer and also testing on my wife's Windows 10 laptop I ended up ordering a phantom power supply and buying another audio interface from a local brick and mortar store. This still did not get the mic working. I spoke with an Audio professional and he walked me through a few hours of trouble shooting and again still was not able to get it working.So after spending almost 300$ on top of the 100$ microphone I ended up RMAing it back as well as the other equipment I bought and went with a Samson C03U which worked immediately out of the box and cost me 90$ without any extra equipment. I'm sure it was probably just a fluke but it left such a sour taste in my mouth I didn't want another one.
