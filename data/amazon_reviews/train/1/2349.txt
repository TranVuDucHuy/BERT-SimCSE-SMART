I found this listed as a lightning deal on Amazon. It's sold as a product for children, but I bought it for myself because I have small ear canals. I wasn't expecting much, but I knew I wouldn't need them all that often. When they arrived, they looked like something you'd pull out of a cereal box. But the size was right, and they worked when I checked them. I also like the red color, because when all the other tech equipment is black, I can see the ear buds without a search.Last night I was listening to music online in the bedroom and my husband wanted to go to sleep. I figured I'd listen with the ear buds for another ten minutes before joining him.I was mistaken.When I plug the buds into my tower, the music stops. I unplug them and then the music isn't playing from the speaker system either! The heck? My spouse, who's an IT professional, said it seems like the act of plugging them in puts the music on pause. To get the music to play again, I had to refresh the page and reload my Amazon music. That done, I tried the ear buds again. Same thing happens. This doesn't occur with my other (uncomfortably larger) ear buds, just with these.How many parents are going to scold their children. "What do you mean they don't work anymore? We just gave them to you! I can't believe you already broke them!"Buying these things was the world's most false economy. Don't you do it.
