I just wanted something cheap so I could watch TV or fall asleep with music on without disturbing my partner.The worst part of this product is the LOUD ***BEEP*** when you lay on your side, it triggers the press and hold function when you lay on your arm. Probably the worst sound choice if you're trying to relax/sleep.The right earbud randomly loses connection.Not very comfortable.Sound is what you expect for $10 earbuds.Battery life seems fine.Case indicators are not user friendly. Confusing and not intuitive.Their app doesn't support these ear buds.Bluetooth connection is fussy when reconnecting. I have to forget device and reconnect to pair every time.Touch controls aren't responsive. Can be frustrating to do simple pause/play/next/prev
