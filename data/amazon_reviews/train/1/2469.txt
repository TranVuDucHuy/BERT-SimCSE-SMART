This is the second portable JBL speaker I have owned and had and the same thing happen to now. My speaker 100% works fine then out of nowhere it will no longer charge. So now I have a brick that can not be disposed of in any responsible manner. Mind you the unit is completely sealed and you open you have to cut it open. When I called to have them repair it since it could be as simple as just changing a charging port maybe they said they can not do anything and I just need to purchase a new one. I do not want a new product I want this one to be fixed and not have more trash created. This item is only 3 years old and have no signs of wear even. Completely unnacceptable.**Update I fixed it myself. I turned it on and was disgusted of the sound quality. I bought a Bose bluetooth speaker when this broke and wow how much better the sounds from that is.
