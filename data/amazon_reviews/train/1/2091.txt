I received these late yesterday evening. I immediately plugged one into my charger thinking I'm now all set w/extras (and will not have to keep using my Mophie juice pack as my only source of power). Woke up this morning to realize I forgot to even plug it into my iPhone, so did so this morning. (Happens...)The cable wasn't charging, so I tried reinserting the USB-A end of it a few times, nothing. Pulled another one out of the pack, same thing. Then another and another...! Only 1 out of 5 cables is functioning, UNBELIEVABLE!!! Somehow this manufacturer managed to make a shoddy cable from PVC that fails like those cheapie nylon-braided types (which I avoid like the plague).Initiated a return/replacement order, but IF I can not get a complete set of 5 to work out of the 10 that'll end up in my possession, sending them all back and going with the current deal from Woot on Amazon Basics (2-Pack, 6 feet for $5.99) and calling this experience another lesson in "Dodge" engineering. Hope this review serves yet as another reminder of how important it is to read the 1/2 star reviews nowadays to avoid headaches ordering stuff online.
