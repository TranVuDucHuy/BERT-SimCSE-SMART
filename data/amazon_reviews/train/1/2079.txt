Good headphones, but should last more than just over 1 year. I don't have a plan to budget headphones into my yearly expenses. Things like this should not be 'disposable' quality.Now I have to open them up to see if I can fix the left side instead of just throwing these away.Will not buy this again.**EDIT** So, I ended up cracking both left and right side cups to identify the issue. A severed wire connection from the primary speaker (where the aux wire goes in) to the left side. I touched the wire to the solder point and it started working. I had to break out my son's soldering iron and some extra solder wire, securely reconnect the wire, and completely put back together. Issue is fixed, however, if more care was taken in the original process to manufacturing these, I wouldn't have had to do this. If somebody wasn't so inclined to fix things themselves, it would just lead to MASSIVE waste when you collectively look at EVERYTHING that is purchased and thrown away daily. It just crazy to me.Take more care and consideration and everything would be better.Oh well.
