When I started to charge up the Poly? 5200 UC I noticed there were just sketchy instructions. A URL was provided for support so I went there. After 10 minutes I was able, at least, to identift my model (I think) The first thing I saw through the gauntlet of irrelevence was the location of the date code. Wondering if I had the latest model I used the guide to locate the date code. There is not a date code on the poly 5200UC that was delivered to me. The page had a photo and an example date code. I tried to find the date code it used for an example and there was no date code chart. I feel as though I have beeen scammed.On 12/33/22, I ordered it and paid for it. I got it the next day as advertised. I found it unexceptable and proceeded to return it. My credit card will not be reimbersed for 14 days from the date they recieve the return. It took exactly "1" instant to take my money. Now it will take 14 days due to "bank admin" to get my money back . Do all retailers think their customers are stupid? Not pleased. Not pleased at all.
