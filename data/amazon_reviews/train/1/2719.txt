I seem to have gotten one of the only ones of these mics that does not work. All four soldering points were in tact and shouldve worked. Tried 13 different cables to try and get sound, none worked. tried with a roland sp 404 and a focusrite 2i2, neither could get any sound from the mic. This is a dynamic mic it shouldn't require phantom power and should work where a condenser mic does not. not the case with my purchase. Im re-soldering all the points and if that does not work I'm screwed.
