Samsung really dropped the ball on their SmartTag products -- they are HORRIBLY UNRELIABLE!!!Finding your SmartTag is something you hope you never actually need to do because it means you've lost something. Unfortunately, if you rely on Samsung SmartTags, you will never find it. That's because the device is poorly supported. The battery WILL die on the tag and you WILL NOT KNOW until you try to find a lost item.It would have been very easy for Samsung to ALERT you when the battery is getting weak, but it DOES NOT. So, when you try to find your tag, you'll realize that the battery has died and it is no longer tracking -- USELESS!!!The hardware might be okay, but the software is unfriendly, complex, and poorly designed.Maybe Apple's tags are better -- I will find out.
