I bought this pack mainly for the 10’ cord and the price was great. The cords feel sturdy and high quality but after charging for a few minutes they stop working. Unplugging/replugging they start working again, but only for a few minutes. I was past my return window so ended up throwing them away. My suggestion: pay more and buy Belkin’s version
