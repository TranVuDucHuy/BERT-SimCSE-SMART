I bought it for its compact size thinking it could be a good companion speaker for everywhere I go. Surface of this speaker is made with slick metal housing that is unable to attach to backpack or bike handle. Speaker has to be placed in the carrying case which degrades the sound a lot, then attach to a backpack. The benefit of compact loses as soon as the speaker is in the bulky carrying case.More serious problem is its poor audio. It lack of dynamic range, contents in different frequency band sound box in and flattened. Bass response is weak and thin. Artist's vocal is muddy and dry as compares to the other compact speakers I have. My overall impression of the sound puts it in a half step above mobile phone's built-in speaker. Just louder but lack of all the exciting details in music tracks.It boasts 8-hour battery playtime however I got roughly 5-hour while playing about a half of iPhone volume level. This number seems misleading.The Bluetooth connection is adequate as long as no object stands between the speaker and the phone. Nothing special in this part.
