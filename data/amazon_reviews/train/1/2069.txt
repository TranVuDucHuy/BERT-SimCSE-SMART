I purchased this when we opened our business and the printer said a new drum was needed. This says approx 12,000 pages. Well I have maybe gotten close to printing 500 items and it wants me to replace the drum again. It has been almost a year so not a ton of printing over the last 12 months but this is ridiculous. Should be lasting me a lot longer. Makes me wonder if it really was a genuine product.Be careful purchasing this item.
