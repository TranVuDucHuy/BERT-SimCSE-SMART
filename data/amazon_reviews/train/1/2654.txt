This was a great little speaker for me to listen to audio books during the day while I worked. I could listen to it for about 20 hours before needing to charge it again. I bought it December 27, 2020 and have used it for about 4 days per week since then. However last night (March 4, 2021) it gave me the low battery warning beeps, and when I went to charge it, it wouldn't work. The red charging light would not come on. This morning I tried different USB cords, connected it to my USB on my computer. connected it to a wall wart, and even used the "secret" reset button, all to no avail. It just won't charge. I'm bummed, but it is what it is and I read quite a few reviews stating this happened to other people. So it's on me for taking the risk. I figured for $12 if I could get a year's worth of use out of it then it was a pretty great deal. However I got about only about 66 days of use out of it and that is just no good. Sometimes you catch a great product, sometimes you don't. This was the latter for me.My husband took it apart and found the battery was only about 6 months old, and there was no charging voltage at the battery terminals when plugged in. Oh, and it is all just held together by glue...lots of glue.
