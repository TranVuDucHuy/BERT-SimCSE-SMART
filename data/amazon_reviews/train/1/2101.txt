The male (Lightning plug) end doesn’t charge phones consistently. It takes effort to find the “sweet spot” to initiate charging. Most times charging stops and 100% of the time the phone is handled, charging stops. I plug into an Apple lightning cable and it’s 100% every time, even if I handle the phone while charging. I’d pass on this despite there being a lot of good reviews. I’ve purchased this item two different times with the same result. Since it’s been 6 weeks I can’t return or replace since the window is 30 days.
