I have had nothing but issues with the headset since I've purchased it. I work remotely for a virtual call center and need to use a headset daily. I was using a wired headset (different brand) with no issues, did not want to be tied down to my computer at all times, but also did not want to remove the headset in case I received a call. I found this headset and the price was great. It seemed to have pretty good reviews apart from a few bad reviews. Set up was simple. The headset itself is very uncomfortable. The padded part that goes over the ear is hard and does not sit in a comfortable way on the ear. When I took my first call using this headset is when I realized there were even more issues. The first person I spoke with said that I sounded very far away from the phone and it seemed as if I had her on speaker phone (which I obviously did not). I moved the mic closer in hopes the sound would get better, but it still seemed as if I had the person on speaker. I went right back to using my wired headset. I wanted to return the headset, set up the return, but forgot to drop off to UPS. Unfortunately, my wired headset quit on me a few days ago, so I was forced to use this as a back up. I was hoping the issues I had when I first purchased were just a fluke thing and the headset would work perfectly. Wrong. Every person that I have spoken with has had difficulty hearing me whether it was "sounds like I'm under water" or "you sound very crackly, you're breaking up". I have had numerous complaints. There are a lot of great reviews on this product. I'm not sure if I was just one of the few that received a bad product, or if the good reviews were paid reviews, either way I would not recommend this product. There are better options out there for wireless headsets. I guess you get what you pay for.
