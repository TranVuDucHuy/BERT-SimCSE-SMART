I opened up the Amazon box and the tag was by itself in this plastic bag. There was no manufacturer packaging or instructions, just there in the box.After watching YouTube on instructions to set up, I tried to sync to my phone but there was no battery life and would not sync. That's when I looked at the tag closer and saw there were many scuff and damage marks where someone has tried to open the battery compartment.Not sure how Samsung would allow this.Definitely was not new and don't want to risk someone else having their info synced to my tag.
