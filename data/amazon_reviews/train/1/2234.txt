I had been using the original Wireless Go I and it was great. The WGII is a whole other experience. The interface is not user friendly and the screen is very difficult to see outside. Now I can live with those cons, but the one terrible thing is the fact that one transmitter won't connect to the receiver nor my computer. I've tried different cables and different ports. I've even reversed the cable, but nothing works. I am boiling since I have a shoot coming up and now I had to go buy the DJI wireless setup instead. What the hell am I supposed to do with my system now? Still waiting on DJI for some help.
