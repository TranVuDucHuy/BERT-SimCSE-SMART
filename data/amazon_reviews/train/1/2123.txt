The Lights and Tripods appear to have been repackaged from Amazon since where were received plastic bag in an amazon box. They were rattling around in the box with the lights and wires all loose. No instructions were included. Pretty lame and was something else missing? After untangling the wires assembly was pretty straightforward. I did figure out how to use the switches. Everything seemed to work fine and should provide the lighting I need for my photography. It's an inexpensive, low budget system that fits my application
