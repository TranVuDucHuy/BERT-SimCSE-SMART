When the item was actually working it was a great speaker. Nice and loud to be so small and portable. But after a few uses it stopped working entirely. Now it just comes on and turns off constantly. And Amazon had such a short return window so I can’t get my F’n money back. I read reviews of exactly what I’m saying and still bought it foolishly. Should have bought straight from JBL website. Or just went with Bose
