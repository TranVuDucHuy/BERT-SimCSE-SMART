**Update** 2/27/2021After I left a negative review, Tonor reached out to me to help resolve my issue. I was busy and ignored their emails. So after trying to make a video last week I knew I needed something else, the volume was way too low.So I contacted them and showed them all my Windows settings. They offered to send me their model TC30 with no obligation to send anything back. I got the new mic in 3 days and it's a nice improvement over the TC-777.What I really like about the TC30 is it does not pickup my keyboard typing. The TC-777 you would here a thumping noise on every keystroke. The volume is louder with the TC30 but it's still not ideal but usable. I will give them a solid 3 stars for at least trying to make good on this. I was very impressed with how quickly they responded to my emails.** end of update **This looks like a really nice microphone but everyone complains they can't hear me. For my videos I have to double the audio before I upload them to Youtube otherwise the volume is way too low. I have adjusted the settings in Win 10 like they suggest but even at 100% it's too low. And I am no more than 10 inches from the mic.
