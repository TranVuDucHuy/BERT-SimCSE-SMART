The pen feels cheap, and isn't very useful.My issues:- Pen won't get constant detection, meaning it's randomly gonna cut off (every few seconds)- Pen triggers the 'use only fold s pen' when it is the correct pen for the fold series. again, pops every few seconds.- Pen lift up still registers as touch which causes the pen to draw when not intended.Overall, fun to use first day, then useless, then defective all around. My worse Amazon product bought.
