These wireless earbuds seem really great initially, sound is good, calls good. However there appears to be an issue with the charging contacts in the case or on the earbuds. They will constantly stop charging and connect to my phone as if I took them out, however they are still in the case. This causes me to miss calls and notifications because my phone will randomly be connected to these earbuds, which automatically sends all sounds to the earbuds. I really wanted to like these but I can't have the earbuds randomly connecting to my phone when in the charging case. They need to pull these and re-design the charging contact mechanism.
