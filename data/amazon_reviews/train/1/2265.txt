AT2020USB is supposedly a good product. My purchase is however a quality disappointment. The mic is sold and shipped by ‘GgsgHhgxiaodiqn’ in China for $120. It appears to be from Japan with a Japanese manual. It took six weeks to arrive, and came with quality problem from the beginning with a very low level of static noise. Eventually in two months the sound quality degraded in clarity. This seller requires us to pay shipping back for return but fortunately Amazon is great to handle a refund for me. I then purchased a second one directly from Amazon store without issue. Stay away from the seller GgsgHhgxiaodiqn
