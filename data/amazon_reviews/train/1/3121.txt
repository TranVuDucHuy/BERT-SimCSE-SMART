I have 8 of these exact SD cards already and they work great in my Nikon Z6ii. I needed more storage space and recently bought one of these SD cards from Amazon and returned it because it was defective. So they sent me another one and that one was defective as well. My camera constantly buffered and froze only when I used the two new cards from Amazon. I went and bought two of these same SanDisk SD cards from B&H Photo and they work great just like my old cards always have. Beware of buying this product on Amazon right now because they must be using a supplier that is making fake, defective cards that aren't really SanDisk.
