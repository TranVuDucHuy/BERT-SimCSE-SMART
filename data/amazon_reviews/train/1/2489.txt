Bought these based on reviews, but they are terrible. The microphone sound quality on every device is so poor that they are unusable for phone calls or online meetings. The right side continually cuts in and our unless it is within 1 foot of the device - again, regardless of whether it is with my tablet, laptop or phone. It's hard to judge the battery life because the Bluetooth and audio quality is so low that I give up on them.Don't waste the time or money.
