The plug in size is slightly smaller than the port so this fits in but constantly (and I mean constantly) falls out. So if you leave you’re phone sitting still you’re good, but if you’re on your phone while it charges you’ll be constantly putting the charger port back in as it continually falls out. Buy a different one than this.
