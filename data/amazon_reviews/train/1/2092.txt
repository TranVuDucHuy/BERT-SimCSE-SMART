These cords are so flimsy I bought them in October and am on the third one in January. The cord is plugged in next to my bed and never goes anywhere and after just a few weeks of normal usage the wire coating is separating from the part that plugs into the phone and wires are poking out. In order to get the cord to actually charge the phone I have to make a little nest so that the wire wonâ€™t move at all. Aggravating.
