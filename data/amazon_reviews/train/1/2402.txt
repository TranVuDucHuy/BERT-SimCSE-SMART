My daughter was happy with these earbuds until they stopped working after only a couple days. This is our second one - I returned the first with the same problem thinking it had to be just a fluke. Nope, these have the same issue. Now I have to go to TWO different locations to drop off these returns because I had already processed the first one to go to Kohls, and when I got there the return line was a mile long. So I have to go back another day. Now, with this 2nd return, Kohls wasn't a choice, so I also have to go to the UPS store. Don't waste your time buying these!!!
