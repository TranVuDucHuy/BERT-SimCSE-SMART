Sure the sound quality is good but the product is awful. Took me 20 minutes to pair, instructions say opening the case should start pairing, that didn’t work. Next it says to try holding the button until you get three flashing lights on the case, that also doesn’t happen(I charged the case and tried like this as well for it to not work). Eventually I held the button for 20 seconds and it finally became discoverable, only for right earbud to not work. Put it back in the case and now it’s become impossible to reconnect again after an already successful pairing.I’ve tried this one 4 different devices and was only able to pair with 1
