This printer does everything I need, Todays date and a future date depending on the expiration of the item that auto generates based on the days current date. The label software is great for this, took me 2 minutes to get 9 labels ready, but there is no way of getting the transferred labels into the file system that holds 99:"Unfortunately, you cannot edit/change the downloaded/transferred template that stored/saved in the machine. This model does not support this option. The current model that supports this option is PTE500-PTE550W. (-help.brother-usa.com)So I have a max of 9 transferable labels in the machine under a special folder. Now have to spend my time doing the labels on the PT-D600 itself, which takes a considerable amount of time, button pushing, and less formatting options. This machine will do the job I need, but I was shown a golden carrot and ate compost instead. If this had a functional editing software that could save in the actual 99 slots instead of just 9 this would have been a hands down 10/10.Update: The memory will only hold 25 labels when you add todays date and a future date. This Labeler has become useless for my project that only needed 35 premade labels.
