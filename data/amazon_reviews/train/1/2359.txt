I've had store brand laminating pouches that were much better than these so I thought they'd at least be just as good. Boy! Was I ever wrong!! If your using a full sheet ofcardstock, these will be decent, not sure how they'd hold up to a full sheet of regular printer paper. Very, very disappointed and will not buy this brand again.
