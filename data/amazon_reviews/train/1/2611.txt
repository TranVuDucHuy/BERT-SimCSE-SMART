I ordered these so I'd have 1 for my extra monitor at home and 1 to keep in my bag when I do presentations for work. These look nice, but the connection is spotty at best. It requires a lot of fiddling and once I get it to actually register that it's connected, I don't dare touch it because the slightest jostle will make it lose connection again. I'm outside of my return window (didn't need to use them until recently), but would definitely return them if I could and go with a different brand.
