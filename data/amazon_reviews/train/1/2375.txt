I liked the length of the cord which is longer than my standard cord that came with my phone. However, when I had plugged it in to charge my phone for about 10 minutes, I went to see if my phone was fully charged and not only was the phone charging slowly but it was very hot to the touch. When I went to unplug it for fear of a fire or explosion, I noticed the wire and even the plug itself was hot. Please I urge all DO NOT BUY this item. It is UNSAFE
