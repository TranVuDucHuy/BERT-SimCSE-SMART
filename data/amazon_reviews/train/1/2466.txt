*UPDATE*The speaker turned on but the speakers were blown. Nothing but static!! I don’t understand why someone would even send a defective product in such terrible condition!!The speaker arrived with dirt stains and obviously used!! Looks like it’s been kicked around! Didn’t even hook it up to see if it works. Probably not!!!
