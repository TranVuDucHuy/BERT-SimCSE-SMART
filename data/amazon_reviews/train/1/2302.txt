Super irritated. Bought one at Staples for $99.99. Returned it because it appeared I could get same unit with a case for the same money on Amazon. After running around returning the one to Staples the same one showed up from Amazon with no case!!! I tried to contact Amazon for a resolution, they made me call Brother. Was on hold with Brother for 3 hours and they will do nothing for me. Misleading false ad by Amazon. This will definitely have me reconsider purchasing from Amazon going forward.
