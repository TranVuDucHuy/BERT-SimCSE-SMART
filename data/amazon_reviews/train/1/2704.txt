Did not like that it did NOT enlarge enough to accommodate my Samsung phone. If it only fit certain phone models it should have specified which Samsung phones. Also in trying to open the part of this where you are supposed to put your phone this thing gives you a nasty painful pinch. I do feel like I wasted money on this.
