Updated Comment- This company reached out with what seemed to be an honest desire to make things right. I was impressed until I learned their solution is give you a $20 dollar credit to start. Once you change your review they give you a $30 credit for a total of $50. I am quite bothered now as my original response email was yes I would be interested in the $50 to make things right and would be happy to change my review if that happened. Now that I know people are being coerced to change reviews- DO NOT BUY THIS BULL CRAP. Further more these unscrupulous people don't realize they have sent me emails intended for 2 other people that they are paying them to change the review the same way they tried to get me to. Initially it seemed to be a good faith effort so I would of been more than happy to adjust my review. Then to find out they do this to shortcut Amazon's algorithms to show they are highly recommended (I understand I was naïve). Just be warned. Their TOZO 6 was a pretty good headphone. THIS ONE NOT SO MUCH. I am glad this occurred as I wont need to buy anything from them going forward. Paying people off is just to keep high ratings. SO sketchy and really this is more an Amazon flaw that does not benefit the customer in the long term. Hope it helps someone else.Original Comment- I was really displeased with functionality. They pick up calls while in the case across my house. The previous era was more intuitive in my opinion. I ended up throwing them away within day because they became so frustrating. One perk was they are as water proof as described. I threw them in water to destroy them so they’d quit picking up calls intermittently until they could be taken to a battery dumpster. Well low and behold they worked for days sitting in water out of range the package said so, if that’s what you’re looking for they defiantly do those things good.
