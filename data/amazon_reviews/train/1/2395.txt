So I purchased this in hopes of being able to help with my volume problem I've had with my microphone and I've waited for about 5 days for it to come in which when I tried to hook it up I got zilch,noda, nothing, both of my xlr cables work and can power my mic but once I hook up the cloud lifter it just stops, like there's no power going to it and makes it seem like both of my xlr cables are faulty, so I plugged both of my xlr mics into it and low and behold both of my mics work, both of my lxr cables work, but the cloud lifter it's self that was 159$ did not....will never recommend for a friend again
