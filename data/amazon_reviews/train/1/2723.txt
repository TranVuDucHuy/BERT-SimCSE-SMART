Bought it on May 19 to make sure I got it in time for an event in late June due to the issues with shipping and COVID. I went to use it and the microphone did not work. Not a peep. Yes, I tried the on and off on the microphone. I tested the speaker with another microphone by another brand. The other microphone and the speaker both worked as they should. The Pyle Microphone was junk from the start. Of course, the 30 day window passed and I cannot return this junk. Save your money and do not buy this brand.
