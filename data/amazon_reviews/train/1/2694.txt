Piece of junk. Been using this not even a week then it burned. If my father wouldn’t smell the brunt plastic, my house would burn down to the ground. No doubt a defective surge protector, it should not be sold. My kids were sleeping with this surge protector burnt and make a loud popping noise, my power outlet sparked and caught fire. It must be a disaster for my family if we don’t catch it on time. It should be recalled for buyers safety.
