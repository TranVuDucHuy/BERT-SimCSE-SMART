I purchased this toner cartridge so I would have a spare on hand. It sat in my home office for about six months before I needed it (I didn't print as much as usual because of COVID work slow-downs). As soon as I put in this new cartridge, my print quality was horrible. Dots in random places on the page, and then eventually a heavy gray haze from top to bottom on the right side. I cleaned the corona wires, the drum, the entire inside of the printer and nothing would fix the print quality. Every time I took the cartridge out to clean something, there would be big piles of black toner all over the floor and desk - what a mess! Finally, after about 50 pages, the print quality was so bad that I tossed the cartridge and replaced with another ... and problem solved. You don't have much choice when it comes to buying toner - let's face it, you have to buy the one that your printer uses - but it would be nice if there was more than a 30-day return policy for defective items. Definitely DO NOT buy this item to keep on hand as a spare unless you are going to use it within 30 days. Otherwise you might be stuck with a very expensive piece of messy garbage!
