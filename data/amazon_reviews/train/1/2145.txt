I bought this product since my vehicle does not have anywhere to hold my phone. When I opened the box to assemble it and see how it worked, the 3 pads that allow it to fit larger/smaller cup holders got stuck inside of the base. After fighting with it and needing to use channel locks, it finally came free.I looked past that and tried it in my vehicle, but noticed after a few uses, it jumped some teeth on the gear section so now it is uneven and can't close fully.I would look for a different item if you want it to last more than a month or so.
