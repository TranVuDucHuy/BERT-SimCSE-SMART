The product was slightly used for over one year in a studio environment. Had occasional very small issues with the clarity of the sound. To mitigate potential issues caused by interferences, I used an RF spectrum analyzer to properly verify that the frequencies are clear of interferences. I was happy with the performance of a $100 receiver and transmitter/mic until the performance degraded to a point of not being able to use one of the mics. The issue I have is that I cannot receive support because there is a "window" for support. SO in other words, I have to buy another system...The expectation is that a product like this would perform for a "slightly" longer period of time...I am waiting for support.
