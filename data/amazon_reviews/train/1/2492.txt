I've had two of these with nibs that broke off in the pen. Once they do this, you are out of luck. There's no way to get the nib remnant out so you can replace it. Samsung should have designed a different way to eject the broken nib piece. I'm going to look for cheaper generic versions. I'm pretty ticked with these and pretty dissatisfied. They are very expensive to be breaking so often with no ability to replace.
