Not enough foam, and the foam it does have is hard as a rock. I tried using them and was getting noise leakage and after about 30 min my ears were hurting. When I tried to switch them back to the original AirPod 2nd Gen, it tore like a wet piece of paper with very minimal force used to get them off. Waste and a shame. Good concept/poor execution!
