I don't know if it was just the one I got, but it did not work as intended. On my phone, I was able to get stereo audio but no microphone, and on my computer, I only got mono audio and still no microphone. I know it's not my headset because it works fine by itself. The material/build quality is nice but that means nothing because I can't use it for its intended purpose. Since it's so cheap it is hardly worth going through the return process so into the trash it goes.
