Received this item on Friday for my daughters Bday. On Saturday she opened it all excited and within minutes had it ready to play. Thatâ€™s when we noticed something was off. The sound was crap!! Which was hard to believe because my brother has the exact same speaker and he loves it. So we played around with it and noticed something seemed off, so we pulled up the Amazon order and noticed that the item inside the box was what we thought was the charge 3 but it was some crappy looks like knock off speaker. Duffle differences were the logos and once my brother brought his over it was very clear on the switch. This made a great day feel like I got ripped off so back in the box this price of trash went.If you buy, open first and give it a good looking at.
