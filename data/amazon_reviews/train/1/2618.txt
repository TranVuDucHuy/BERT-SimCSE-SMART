As some other 1 star reviewer mentioned, it constantly makes my macbook and the 2 external displays (the one using this cable and the one directly plugged into my macbook pro) blink into black, it happens every time my macbook or table move a tiny bit, and when it happens the blinking takes 30+ seconds to get back to normal, to shortly after start blinking again. Imposssible to get any work done with this, will try to return but I threw away the box because the product seems of great quality when you unbox it, they use nice materials, but the adapter itsefl is useless for the reasons I explained.
