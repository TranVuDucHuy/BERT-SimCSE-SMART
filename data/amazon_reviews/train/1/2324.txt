I wished I could return it.I was cut on the finger 2 times because closing the legs. It was my nightmare until now, I did not want to use it any more.The design is so terrible for closing. I was very careful after the 1st cut on the finger, but I was still be cut on the 2nd when closing it. Someone reviewed about the cut when closing, but I did not pay attention until I bought and used it. OMG, it cut my fingers so terrible... :( Now, I am scared of using it,the battery of remote is not hold longer for using.
