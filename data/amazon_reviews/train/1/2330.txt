The battery is a crap. It does not charge at all. When u plug in, it’s red. Then after a min or so, it goes off. The red goes off when it’s fully charged, according to the manual. When I got the product, it was 56%. So I charged it. The manual says it takes 2 hours to be fully charged. The red light went off in a min so it was strange. I check the battery and it was 55%. I charged again anyway for close to 2 hours then it was 54%. WTF? It does not charge at all. Total waste of money. This brand sucks. Do not buy this brand.
