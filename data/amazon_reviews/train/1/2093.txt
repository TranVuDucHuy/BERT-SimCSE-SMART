I’ve had these chargers for about 2 months? and at first it was great. they worked. about a week in the first one broke and i was like okay it happens. It has now been two months and every single one has broke. i ordered these bc my charger finally broke after two years so it’s not like i was doing anything. i always handle my chargers well. but these just kept breaking. it would’ve been better to buy one or two and have it last a long time then these five and have to buy more and save money in the end.
