I recently purchased the Bokilino Cup Car Phone Holder for Car, and unfortunately, I have to say that I am very disappointed with the product. The holder broke within a week of using it, and upon closer inspection, it appears to be made out of cheap materials such as cast pewter or aluminum. The construction of the holder is also very poor, and it seems like it was not made to last. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a durable and reliable car phone holder. Save your money and invest in a holder that is made with better materials and construction.
