I bought this product in good faith in 2017. It turned me into a fairly decent sized fan of JBL. The sound quality on the ones that I had purchased were very very good .untill they started getting a little older ,when the battery started going bad on them. Now I have to keep them plugged in all the time otherwise they won’t work at all .when I contacted JBL not to get anything for free but to repair the components that I already own, I got no response. Only a response from the people that are dealing this product, that’s telling me the warranty is over and we don’t repair the items. So basically if your component breaks after the warranty you can’t get it fixed ?just throw it away and buy another one like they want you to do ? why would anybody buy any product that the manufacture does not stand behind their product. I didn’t even mention the one that I bought for my brother-in-law as a Christmas present that when charging it for two hours one evening, self-destructed and almost burned the house down. And no they were not miss charged. So I guess if you’re the type that likes to buy throwaway items this is a product for you ..after all they do sound very nice when they are working but I guess after they quit working can you just simply throw them in the trash can because after that they are worthless .no one to help fix them, JBL being the top people that should be helping the customer but they are not! I am going to move on now, not ever buying another JBL product. Hope you people get wise and do the same. After all, I am just trying to help the fellow customer, because no one else seems to have our back.
