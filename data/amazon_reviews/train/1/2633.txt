BUYER BEWARE- Please don't buy this 127 Ink from this Seller!Chances are that if it sounds like a great deal and too hard to believe the price there is a reason for that happening. I just purchased a black cartridge and also three pack of 127 XL Colors which includes magenta, cyan, and it's yellow cartridges. I have only had this product a few days and went to install and my printer today. My printer does not recognize any of these cartridges and upon further notice I could tell that the ink was all dried out inside of the package. I'm not sure if it was full to begin with or not. Don't waste your money getting this great deal because you were not Product that is 100% guaranteed to work in your Epson printer. Don't even think of buying apps and ink from any place but a reliable local office supply store who will back off their product with a replacement if needed. I have had this printer for two years and never had this happen once and I never buy generic brand ink for any of my printers. Very disappointed with this purchase and wish I could get my money back from this seller who is advertising this as a new product.. Buyer beware!
