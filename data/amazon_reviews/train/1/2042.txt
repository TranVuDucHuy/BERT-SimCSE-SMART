I added a picture so you could see the side of this after one month and perhaps a few weeks more of light use. I used it for a 45 minute commute two ways to get to work and back. The circuit board started to buckle out of the housing. The side plastic started to peel and wrinkle. The charge stopped lasting longer than one 45 minute use (definitely not 24 hours) and if I left the earpiece on or off, it would still lose charge in a day. Charging had to happen once a day, which was okay until it realised it didn't even hold for the trip back in the same day. Now, it won't even hold any charge, and it won't turn on.When it worked, the sound quality was pretty good, clear, and the noise cancelling was good enough to talk to someone when the window was down and blaring wind.The worst part of this thing is that it only lasted for just over a month and it never held a charge for the full 24 hours (ever). If there is a 60 days standby time, then I got the dud of the batch. It wouldn't even last 24 hours.I cannot recommend this earpiece if you want something that will last for better than a month or two.Also, my attempt to write customer service (in the booklet) was met with no reply, and since it is over the time for returns, I'm out the purchase price. Chalk it up for lesson learned.
