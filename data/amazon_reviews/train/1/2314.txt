READ UPDATE BELOW. 4 STARS TO 1 STAR…Definitely better than the last headset I tried... so happy I splurged on this one before returning the other... the difference is night and day. Sound quality is really good. I cant really comment on battery life yet, but did have it on for many house and all was good. Pairing was easy and so I have to say I really like it. Giving it 4 stars because its not 100% perfect. Ear buds are still the best but I wear them so often inside one of my ears is hurting so having a headset is amazing. Definitely recommend this headset.UPDATED REVIEW…After having it a while the charging station no longer charges. I have a dead headpiece that is unable to be charged and have to dump it. It was good but its worthless as it cannot charge. I tried 12 different plug ins too, it wont charge. Very very angry - dont buy!
