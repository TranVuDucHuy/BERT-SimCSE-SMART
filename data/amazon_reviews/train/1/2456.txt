I have bought this product in the past and have used it religiously, but my most recent replacement had a new type of charger, which is fine, but the battery arrived broken. I have not been able to charge the product, even trying different cords hoping that the charger was to blame. Without being able to charge it, I was only able to use it one time. The one time I used it was great, but doesnâ€™t make up for the battery failing.
