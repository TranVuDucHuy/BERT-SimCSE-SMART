Caused a click on the receiver end everytime the audio was sent on the sender end. Caused all kinds of problems! For example, I had to call into a radio broadcast over Skype. Every time I spoke (and sometimes when I wasn't speaking) there was a click sound and my voice was cut off for a fraction of a moment. It was enough to really damage the conversation over the air. It does boost the gain, as advertised, but this was an unexpected issue. When the Cloudlifter was removed from the mix, the problem went away!
