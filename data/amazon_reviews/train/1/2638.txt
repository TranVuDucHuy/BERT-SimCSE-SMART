I bought a number of cartridges in January 2020 to make sure I have some always on hand when I need it. I just used one of these cartridges now and when it first loaded it only showed 3/4 full on the printer status screen. I thought it might be a printer glitch but now after only 60 pages of B&W printing it's showing as 3/4 used, and I had a lot of problems with clogged heads. The expire date on the box is 3/2023 so that shouldn't be an issue. No way to get a replacement or credit after this amount of time but I sure didn't get what I paid for. An "XL - Extra Large" cartridge for 60 pages? Not my usual experience with Epson but disappointing for sure as these are not cheap.
