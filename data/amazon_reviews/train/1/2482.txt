I received these as a gift since an earbud from my previous headphones from another brand stopped working. I like the sound quality, the ease of pairing with my phone, the general comfort, the button functionality, and the look. However, the earbud tips stay stuck in my ear whenever I remove them! I did not read the reviews before selecting them, but after this experience, I found another user had the same issue. That has never happened to me before, and it should never happen with any sort of headphone, no matter the price. It is a nuisance and a safety issue, since I have had to use pliers to get them out of my ear every time. I have tried three earbud tip sets, two of the sizes included with these headphones (one of which did not provide a good seal, so the forces on the tips should have been minimal) and another set from another set of earbuds. Since a good seal is required for optimal sound quality and noise isolation, this is a major issue with the design. It is a design issue since I have looked at the connector for the earbud tips versus another set of headphones I have, and there is a clear difference, with the other ones never giving me this problem. The issue becomes more obvious when removing the tips from these APEKX headphones takes significantly less force than any other headphones I recall having. See the photo for the design difference. I will be returning these but I wanted to leave a review first to help those considering buying them. If the company fixes this issue, then they will become a valid competitor to other brands.
