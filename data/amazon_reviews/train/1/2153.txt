I have been wanting new headphones for a while now, and after doing tons of research, I finally decided to purchase these. I was so excited for my new headphones, and boy were they a dissappointment.They would not pair with my iPhone, they would not pair with my husbands iPhone, they would not pair with my friend's iPhone, they would not pair with my friend's android, they would not pair with my PC laptop, the list goes on. I tried EVERYTHING, I had other people try everything to see if I was doing something wrong, I tried troubleshooting in every possible way and they simply would not pair.I thought maybe these particular one's might have been defective, so I exchanged them for a new pair from Amazon.I just got my new pair in the mail and they STILL will not pair with my phone or any other divice! I tried Soundcore customer support this time and after troubleshooting with me, we STILL could not get the headphones to go into pairing mode, so I finally decided to stop wasting my time and return these ones as well.I have lost quite a bit of time and energy at this point trying to make these headphones work because I WANTED them to work, I like ANKER products generally, but I just think these headphones are not a good product and advise people to avoid them. I encourage people to just spend the extra money on some airpods, which is what I think I am just going to do.I would give zero stars if I could.
