I found the mid to low range to be too light. The speaker is very unstable placed on surface that has a slight angle. Pretty much has to be on a flat surface or you have use something to prop up the speaker or it rolls over. My last Sony speaker I had would give me an verbal notice that the battery is getting low, the flip doesnâ€™t. If my Sony battery died, I could plug it in to the charge cable, charge the battery and listen to music at the same time. The flip will not work with a dead battery and the charge cable is Hooked to it. So I have to wait for the charge level to come up before I can listen to any music. Very disappointed!!!!
