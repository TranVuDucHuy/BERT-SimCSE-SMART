I wanted wireless headphones to exercise with, but I have tiny ears, so I searched for buds for small ears and this product came up with good reviews. When I received them they still were a bit big for my ears(it kept falling out and needed a lot of readjustment), but that's no fault of the product so I kept them. One month later, the right earbud stopped working. It would still charge and connect, but had no sound. Being the trooper that I am, I decided to just use the working one and figure out the issues later. Big mistake! A couple weeks after that, the next earbud also lost sound. That is when I found out that SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT FOR THIS PRODUCT. I've had better experiences with $20 headphones bought at the checkout line in Marshalls. I do not usually write reviews but this is the worst product I have purchased on amazon so had to make people aware.To recap:YOU WILL BE THROWING MONEY AWAY IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT!
