Update Review!!! July 11, 2022. This thing just flopped, actually about a month or so ago...(I just happened upon this while searching for a particular purchase). Will not hold my phone up at all, or anything else for that matter..its like it just stripped itself, I only used it like 3 or 4 times since I purchased it...this is a very expensive piece of worthless trash! DO NOT BUY!!!Now for the original review when I had first received it and was oblivious as to how horrible the quality is:Works fine just be careful with the piece that has the 3m sticky on it that sticks to dash or glass, I'm on my 2nd one and haven't attempted to install it yet but first one the sticky part just peeled completely off the holder so they sent me this one! So I can't really say if its good or not. I do know I tried peeling off the 3m again and it almost peeled off the entire holder again, some of it did, so don't know how well it will work? Should've just got my money back and moved on!!!
