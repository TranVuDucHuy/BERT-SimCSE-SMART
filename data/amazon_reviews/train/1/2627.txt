This is the second time I have had a SanDisk card go bad . Fortunately I didn't loose the pictures on the card, but any pictures I take aren't recognized by the camera and only show up on the computer. I called SanDisk customer support for assistance, and they told me the usual to copy all my pictures to a computer and format the card. I told them I wanted to keep all the original pictures on the card since they were still readable. They told me they will only replace the card if I send it back or if I break it in half and send them a picture of the card in two pieces. I keep all my original photos on the SD card as a backup as well as on my computer which is why I don't want to format the card. Neither of these options were satisfactory to me, so I am writing this negative review, and will look into purchasing a different brand card. They could not answer why this happened. This happened on the same day of using this card without ever taking it out of the camera. It was recording fine, I turned the camera off, went to a new location 5 minutes later and all those pictures appeared as question marks when trying to preview in the camera.
