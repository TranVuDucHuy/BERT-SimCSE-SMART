I have a cheap $15 pair of mpow headphones that are much better at drowning out human voices than this more expensive Sony pair. With this pair, I can hear my roommate across the hall speaking at a normal level. None of the noise cancelling or ambient sound features seem to fix that. Very disappointing, especially for the price.
