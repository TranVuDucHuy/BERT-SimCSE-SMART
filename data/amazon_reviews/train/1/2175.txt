This car mount is pretty much worthless and I will explain why. Sure, the mount itself suctions to your windshield or dash just fine but who cares about that if the mount magnet won’t hold your phone!? This thing won’t hold my iPhone 13 ProMax even in the raw form, even though it is marketed as being able to hold the iPhone plus any protective device attached to the phone like an Otter Box. Highly disappointed, because I research and do my homework on every product that I purchase on Amazon and this product fit exactly what I was looking for. The reality is that it was falsely advertised.
