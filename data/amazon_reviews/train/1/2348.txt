I wanted to get a cheap pair of earbuds for when I couldn't use my over ear headphones. I ordered these based on the huge number of positive reviews. I got them today and they just don't work. I tried plugging them into my pc and didn't get audio. I then turned off my pc and unplugged and then plugged in my front panel audio cable. No luck. Tried it on my iphone and no audio there either. When I tried to return/get a refund amazon tells me this product can't be returned. When I try to submit for a refund it redirects me back to the returns page and tells me it can't be returned. Panasonic wants me to ship the product to them with the risk of me being responsible for shipping and handling if they determine it works. Frankly for a $8 product not worth the hassle or risk of shipping twice the price of the item.
