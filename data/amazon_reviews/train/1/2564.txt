Not only are these earbuds huge but they will not stay connected. The connection is really flakey and inconsistent. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. The audio cuts in and out making it impossible to listen to anything and really annoying. Totally useless.I have other earbuds that I use with the same devices and they work just fine with no issues but these will not. I have a pair of the Tozo T6s that I really like and I was hoping that these would be just as good but unfortunately they're not even close.Aside from the connection problem there are a couple other things that I don't like about these.One is the size. These things are huge in comparison to the T6. Not only the buds themselves but also the case. The only reason why that I can think of is battery life but I haven't been able to check this because I never got to use them long enough to see. I have no issues with the T6's battery life. They last a long time. Sometimes up to eight hours which I think is great.The other issue that I have is that these are not interchangeable between ears. The right one will only fit comfortably in the right ear and the left bud only in the left ear. I like using only one at a time a lot of times like when I'm walking or just want to have one ear available for ambient sounds so being able to wear either bud in either ear is a huge plus for me. Also this way I get to keep one charged while listening to the other. If this is important to you then look elsewhere.All in all I'd say stay away from these and buy the T6s instead. They're not only better quality but cheaper in price as well.
