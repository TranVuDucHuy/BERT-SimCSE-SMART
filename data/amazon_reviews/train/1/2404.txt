I wanted to love them. I actually adored them for as long as they lasted. I think the design is perfectly minimalist and sleek, the battery life is amazing, they cancel out noise very well and the earbuds stay put even while working out.HOWEVER, the left eardbud is faulty.I ordered a pair and suddenly the left earbud started making some weird electrical/static sound. Customer service was amazing & shipped a new pair. However, about 3 weeks to a month of usage, the left earbuds of this pair has also stopped working.It just cant be a coincidence. I havent dropped them, gotten water in them, nothing.It is a shame. It was a waste of money and now I have to workout with only the right earbud on while I get a replacement. So annoying
