This was a Christmas gift for my son, who likes to listen to podcasts as he goes to sleep at night. He wore it one night and says it was very uncomfortable, especially if he tried to lay on his side. The next time, he says the sound was funny — as it it wasn’t connecting well — and still very uncomfortable. He didn’t try to use it again for weeks… but when he tried, he couldn’t get it to turn on. We tried several times to charge it, but nothing happened. It’s dead. And he had already thrown away the box it had come in, so we could return it. So very disappointing. I’d love a refund.
