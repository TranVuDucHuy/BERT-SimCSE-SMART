Everyone seemed to be able to hear me fine, but what I heard in the headset was very tinny and not the best quality. I found the headset very difficult to charge on the stand - it was challenging to figure out the exact right way to set it on there to charge (and stay charging). Those alone were probably a good reason to return it (which I did), but it was the most uncomfortable headset I've ever used. I wanted to replace my bluetooth eatbuds which can be uncomfortable after several hours, but I don't think I lasted 45 minutes with this before my ear felt like it was burning. It was way too tight around my head. I don't have a gargantuan head. :) It just pressed so hard against my ear because of the tight fit that it was slamming the back of my ear into my eyeglasses and was really difficult to wear. I tried the other ear, but it was just as uncomfortable. The earbuds were more comfortable. I also found the controls a little difficult with one button to do almost everything. I thought I turned it off, but I hadn't, and you need to sit around and wait for a light to blink and then how long/often it blinks to determine what it means. Way too complicated and uncomfortable to keep.Edit 9/19/20 - I just dropped this from three stars to one star because I have been contacted twice by seller offering me a $30 incentive to delete this "bad" review. They have been reported to Amazon because this is against their rules for sellers.
