So first off a question to Samsung. I have been a loyal user of the Note since they first started - this time around since there was no note I decided to go for the more luxurious Galaxy Z Fold 3. Wandering around online seeing pens for the Fold I thought wait a second, did mine even come with one? So let me get this straight - a Note which is what 500 cheaper than this thing has a pen that comes with it - yet 1700 dollars and it doesnt even come with a dang pen? Secondly - you cant even use it on the front screen only when you fold it out. Worthless if you are not using the big screen. Waste of money.
