Ordered last night, received today and instantly returning after trying it on. Had high hopes after all the reviews but this mask is terrible. I could not resize the mask to keep the headphones in the ear and the mask tight against the face. If the mask was tight against my face the earbuds were behind my ears. There should also be eye cups so you can open your eyes comfortably while wearing this mask. Looks like Iâ€™ll be spending the extra money to get the Manta Sleep Sound.
