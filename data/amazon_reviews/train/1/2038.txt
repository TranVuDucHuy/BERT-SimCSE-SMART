This doesn't fit well onto the air vent nor does it hold my android properly. The edges of this are too short to fully clasp onto and hold the sides of the phone, which causes the phone to pop out. I also have to try to clip it in near the top or the bottom of my phone because if I clip it in the middle it presses on the volume control and power buttons.
