Well here it goes....As a semi truck driver I was looking for a smaller headset to replace my blue parrot (C400 XT) and came across this one after reading a few Google reviews.I received a brown box with a black and white picture sticker on it. Not an attractive packaging, but I couldn't care less of packaging. Wasn't looking for wow factor in product display.After taking it out of the box, it's a nice looking earpiece and it charged up pretty fast, then everything goes south.Battery life- Horrible. Last about 4 hours if you're lucky.Sound quality- Terrible. No matter which end you're in. Listeners have told me I sound like I was talking insides of an aluminum can.The volume on my end was low and I can hear various callers with an echo effect.Charging port is the going out Micro USB which sucks having to carry two types of cables if you have a newer USB-C charging port on your phone.I would stay away from this one, EVEN if you were to use it as a backup, definitely not worth it for seventy nine dollars.
