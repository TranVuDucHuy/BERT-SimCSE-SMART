How is this microphone so highly rated?? The volume level is horrible - it doesn't sound any different than those old dollar store "microphone" toys. You cannot hear your voice from the speaker unless the volume AND echo is all the way up, and even then it's barely loud enough to hear. The mic also wouldn't even connect to my phone via bluetooth (nothing else was connected) after trying multiple times. I had to use the cable that was included to connect to my phone to play music at the same time. Again, the music volume at its highest left much to be desired (my phone alone would have played the music at a higher volume than this speaker) AND everytime the cable moved slightly it would make a staticky sound. The charging/aux out port is very poorly built - it was hard to even plug the cable in. I was planning on using this microphone just for fun at home, and was genuinely excited for it to arrive. However, this is probably one of the worst purchases I've made to date. Don't waste your money on this.
