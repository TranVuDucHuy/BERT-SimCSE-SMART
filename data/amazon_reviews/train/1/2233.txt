Â Rode is supposed to be a well established brand, so although the mic wasn't cheap I figured it's worth it. It's a known fact that a video is only as good as its audio.Unfortunately, the product has been an utter nightmare, and cause me hunderds of hours worth of damages by losing tons of content.The product adds noise in a very inconsistent matter, rendering it pretty much useless. It'll do that about 35% of times, so when you shoot content you roll the dice on whether it's going to be usable or not.Anyone who does content knows that you can pause after each shot to check whether the take has been recorded well, and anyone who does content understands how painful it is to take 2 hours worth of footage and get a lot of it deleted due to technical difficulties.I've been trying to get this situated by updating the firmware, using external mic, various cables - none helped. Rode support takes weeks to respond, and don't provide insights too.Meanwhile, I'm bleeding time and content due to my $200 brick.Furthermore, when the product does actually work, the sound itself is subpar. Without the technical difficulties I'd give it 3 stars, but the fact it's so extremely unreliable makes it a denifite 1 star product.I cannot express enough how painful this experience has been for me, I wish I'd be warned. Stay away.
