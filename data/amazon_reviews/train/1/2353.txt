The instructions are clear and easy to follow. However, when you need to get the adhesive and clear sheet apart, it's extremely difficult. After beginning to separate the two, the adhesive ripped and was no longer a full page, but spots of adhesive where it cleanly separated. Therefore I will not be able to get successful tattoos out of this. I would not recommend this product unfortunately.
