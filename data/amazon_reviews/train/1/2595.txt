The swivel attachment to the back of the holder fell apart as soon as I went to install it for the first time in my car. Extremely disappointed with the so-called durability. There may be cell phone holders that work well with adjustable AC vents. Believe me, this ain't one of them. Had to return it for a full refund. Lesson learned.
