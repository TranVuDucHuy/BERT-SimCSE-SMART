I really wanted this product to work. After reading all of the reviews I thought this would be a hit. We have an iPad we put in between our front seats that allows our kids to watch while we are driving on long trips. The problem is for them to hear the movies, we have to turn the volume way up which at that point seems like it's right in my wife and I's ears and way to loud for us.We purchased this item to prevent this issue and allow our kids to wear head phones of their own while my wife and I can talk and or listen to the radio.Unfortunately right out of the box these did NOT Work no matter what we tried. One headphones could hear just fine while the other could barely hear or nothing at all at times. We were really bummed as we were hoping to add this to our default list of things to pack for our road trips.Maybe we just got a bad set but I will NOT be recommending these to anyone. Don't waste your time or money on these.
