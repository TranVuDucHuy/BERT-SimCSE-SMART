I bought one August 28 and had to reorder another one in November. 20. I thought it would last longer. I am a small office with 1 1/2 staff. At most we print 2,000 pages/month. I read that a drum should be able to print 15,000 pages which it did not. According to the terms I can not return it. How was I to know that it would not last and that it should of been capable of printing 15,000 pages.
