This product worked excellent the first few days. But it definitely did NOT last a week for me. It started to Drain the battery life instead! it shows that it’s charging but you can see the battery life going down.I went to sleep with my phone battery life at 80% using this charger and woke up to it at 2%. And I swear when you’re charging it while using it, the battery life goes down faster… I want to return this cheap broken product! I think it’s harming my phone battery where I’ll have to replace a whole new iPhone battery instead.UPDATE: I Used the second and third cord.. charged one time and then WONT charge anymore! Battery life just drains away!!! JUNK!!!No wonder they don’t do returns!!! They just want your money!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I REPEAT. DO NOT BUY THIS CORD!!! All the good reviews are paid to write their positive reviews I swear. I am so disappointed!
