Microphone connects and sounds fine, the integrated on/off switch is made of a dirt cheap plastic part that keeps falling out upon the tiniest disturbance. It’s a miracle I haven’t lost it yet. Not sure if this is standard or if mine was defective, but I will be contacting Pyle for warrantyEDIT: I was able to contact support and get a replacement, the new microphone works fine
