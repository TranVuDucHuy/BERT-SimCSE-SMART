Received the box of Epson ink and it had a expiration date of 09-2019. Amazon or Epson covered up the expiration date with a sticker. On 9-20-2022 I had to buy a new box from Walmart and replace Yellow and Magenta cartridges because the ink dried up and my printer showed it was still usable. The expiration date on the new box from Walmart is 11-2023.
