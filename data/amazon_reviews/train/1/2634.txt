Cartridge and package didn’t look old or counterfeit but immediately after I put it in my printer and it self-charged/cleaned, the print head clogged. Ink spilled all over pages and it wouldn’t print anything. I read that in cases of print heads clogged and ink spills to print 10 pages of dense text. Over 100 later and I could maybe read the print. I’ve gone through a half team of paper and nearly half the ink cartridge. It self cleaned again and the problem began again. I’m going to have to buy a whole new printer. Wasted the cost of this ink and the printer.
