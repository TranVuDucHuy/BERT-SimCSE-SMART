I misunderstood most of the features before purchasing, and realized after I got it that it does not do any of the things I expected it to do. The sound quality is ok if all you want to do is play music from phone and sing along with it and play on the speaker. I had other plans and none of them worked as expected. Here are the responses I got from the seller when I asked for details:1. I thought the mic would show up as a USB input on the computer, so that I can use it for recording and sharing on Zoom. That is NOT the case. Seller response: The USB connection to computer is only for charging.2. I thought the USB to headphone jack output would send the music streaming from the phone as well as your vocals (i.e., mix the two signals), but that is also NOT the case. Seller response: Regarding the problem of song recording, if you want to record your voice and music on your computer, you need to use the computer and microphone connection, and use the song recording APP on the computer to play songs and then sing together.You are connected to a microphone and mobile phone, and play music on the mobile phone, so the sound of the music will not be recorded on the computer.3. I thought you can use the microSD card to record your music, but that is NOT the case. Seller response: The microphone only supports micro SD card no more than 32GB, and the micro SD card can only play music, and the microphone can only recognize MP3 format songs, can not record songs through the microphone. Because our microphone only has an output function.
