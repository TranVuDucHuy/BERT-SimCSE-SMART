I could not get to main menu, screen said "waiting for license key". Tried resetting it several times, no change. Emailed company, they asked for proof of purchase and I included a photo of screen requesting license key and proof of purchase. Instead of helping me they requested more information and there response was very slow. I think it should work out of the box, having the run around for a license key is just bad business. I do not recommend this product due to poor customer service.I was very disappointed.
