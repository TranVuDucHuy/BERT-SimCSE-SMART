They put vents in headphones so you can hear outside of them. But the problem is if you work around anything that makes noise you will not be able to hear absolutely anything and the sound is extremely quiet in these these are the opposite of noise cancellation. And battery life doesn't really compete with any other headset. I'm returning these to get a cheap pair that has noise cancellation with best customer review best way to find good items. (Life hack)
