I am VERY unhappy with the product. It doesn’t even deserve one star. EXTREMELY limited printed instructions came with the product, video on Amazon suggests that all the parts magically open by just holding the product at the correct angle. Totally useless. Even the typed directions above are unhelpful. Push tripod open? WHERE? HOW? Plug in the USB mini charger? WHERE is the port? The directions for finding this port are practically non-existent - a line drawing with no guidance as to WHERE on the tube the port is located. I STILL haven’t found it., even with using a magnifying glass AND a flashlight; nor have I been able to open the tripod yet. After reading the directions above, I’m afraid I’m going to break this if I keep trying to open it. It’s not like I haven’t had devices like this before, but this one is a nightmare. If I can return it for free, I will be doing that ASAP.
