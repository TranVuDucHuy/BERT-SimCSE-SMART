I *never* leave reviews. I needed these earbuds for my online classes... the earbuds arrived on time, in nice packaging, easy to plug in and use, but the right ear bud is silent. Only the left earbud works. I've tried returning/replacing them, and Amazon only lets me select options to "troubleshoot" my problem or "continue shopping". They do not allow me to return the item as defective and order a new pair.
