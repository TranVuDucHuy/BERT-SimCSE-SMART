Nice design and colorful, but the functionality is missing due to the strength of the magnets and length of the silicone tether. Difficult to keep wrapping over and over when the cord/earbuds arenâ€™t very thick and the tie wants to unwind constantly. Very cool concept but lacking finesse with real life application.
