The tripod is fine but I plugged in the Bluetooth remote to charge it & turned my back to continue about my day. Before leaving my room I start noticing this weird smell that kind of smelled like fire. I picked up the remote & took it out the charger & it was really hot & smoking. If I left my room I probably couldâ€™ve burned my house down. The tripod is fine though but the remote !!!! No . I got the 60 inch black tripod.
