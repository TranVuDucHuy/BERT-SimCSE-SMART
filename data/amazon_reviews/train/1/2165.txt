This stand provides support for the bottom of the phone and the lower 2 1/2 inches. If you're going to answer a call or make a call with the phone in your hand and then place it into the stand, it'll work great. If you're going to touch the screen while it's in the stand, it's not going to work as there's nothing really holding the phone in place to prevent it from moving when you touch it.
