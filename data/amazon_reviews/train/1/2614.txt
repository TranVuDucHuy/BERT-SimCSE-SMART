Absolute garbage. Straight up doesn’t work. Finally went to use it after moving + getting my desk set up in my new home, and of course it doesn’t work. Return window is closed. Screen popped onto the desktop I was attempting to connect it to for a second, then turned off. Glad I have to now keep dud trash. Needless to say, I will not be attempting to try another one from this seller.
