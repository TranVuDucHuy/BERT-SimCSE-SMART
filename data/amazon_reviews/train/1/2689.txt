I was so excited for this product to come but when I got it there was no instructions. It is quit easy to put together but this was my first time buying this type of item. On the light, microphone and extender to hold those was turned to tightly and I had I very hard time loosening it, so much so my hands started bleeding. All that time was wasted because the microphone broke anyway!
