This is the easiest phone holder to install - but at the cost of a few major drawbacks.The first issue is that this phone mount is not terribly sturdy. The phone gripping part is just fine - it's never dropped my phone - but the part that connects to the vent routinely loses its grip and I'm regularly losing my phone onto the floor while I'm driving. It works most of the time, but it's like 20-30% of the time that I'm fishing around on the floor for my phone after hitting an average road bump...or none at all.Second, the attachment to the vent very quickly starts to expose sharp metal. I've never cut myself on it, and had to go digging around to even find it, but this is the second one of this model I've ordered, and both have significantly scratched whatever my car vents and any dash parts I've attached them to. It's definitely a design flaw for this model since both of the items I ordered - years apart - are scratching my cars in the same way. I wasn't sure how it was happening, but careful inspection shows that the metal starts to cut through the rubber, and I guess when it's stretched to hold onto the vent, it gets exposed.Unfortunately, this is about the only type of phone holder that works for my car - otherwise I'd never use it. But would I recommend it? Only if you're as desperate as I have been to find something to provide hands-free phone access after trying virtually every other type of phone holder. Plus, it's affordable - that part is nice.
