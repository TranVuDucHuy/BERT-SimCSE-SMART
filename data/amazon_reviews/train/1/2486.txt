They break very easily. My boyfriend flinged them off the bed because he quickly grabbed the sheets and threw them forcing my headphones in their case to fly and hit the wooden bedroom floor hard knocking them out of the case. I just got them the night of February 23, 2022. Two weeks later was when the incident happened. I thought the right earbud died/stopped working for a brief moment. Heard sound they following day and didn't pay no mind to it. As time went on, the right earbud kept up the "no sounds" even when I tapped on it so that I can get the sound back. Now today, March 27, 2022 (in the morning of today), I noticed no sounds at all coming from the right earbud.Within the first two weeks, I was using the earbuds to talk on the phone and yet I couldn't hear what the person was saying when both earbuds decided to cut off the sound. I thought it was my phone at first but quickly realized it was the earbuds. I don't know if they got damaged during shipping and delivery and then two weeks later my boyfriend decides to finish them off or what. All I know is I've been having problems since I got them. I tried to see how long they could last.Can I get a refund?
