Wow, I hardly EVER right reviews. But I am a twitch streamer and the second I got this unpacked, (keep in mind I have already been using the AT2020 for two years and it just went bad, so I decided to order a new one.) this product is LITERALLY almost IDENTICAL to what I bought two years ago, except the fact that I cannot actually use it... the USB cable has NO way at all to plug into the back of my gaming PC or Streaming dual pc set up... Don't you think you should include that cord for, ya know the actual people that will be using it... ?This was by far the biggest waste of my time and money and I am beyond upset.EDIT: OKAY so doing some further research, and exchanging it the original AT2020USB that I was referring to above was actually discontinued sometime between now and 2020 and there was that monstrosity I ordered in its place (which you need a separate box [sold separately, cause course] in order to connect the microphone to the box and then THAT to the PCâ€¦. Musicians and podcast and YouTube creators do this and utilize this.I was able to find the USB one similar enough to my 2020 purchase from three years ago.TLDR: MAKE SURE IT SAYS AT2020USB unless you actually want to get the podcast and streaming one, just know you will have to spend an additional $$$ for the box to connect it to your PC. :) I hope this helped.
