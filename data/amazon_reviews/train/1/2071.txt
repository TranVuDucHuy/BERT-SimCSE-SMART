Bought this item from Brother and shipped by Amazon. So it has to be authentic, but it stop working in 2 month. Cant return item, dont have customer support for the item. Complete waste of money to buy from Brother. Aftermarket parts would last longer than this. What's the point of buying OEM if they break in 2 month. i would have to print 200 pages a day for it to worn out it's listed 12000 pages.
