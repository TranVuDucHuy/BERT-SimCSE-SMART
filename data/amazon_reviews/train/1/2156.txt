I want to give these a good review. The sound quality is great, battery life is quite decent. However, I misplaced the charging case and can no longer use the ear buds. Anker sells replacement cases, but they are out of stock. When I tried to contact customer service, they said they have no idea how long it would be until they replenish stock. I can't find a replacement case anywhere online short of buying another pair of earbuds. I was really happy with these initially, super disappointed now.
