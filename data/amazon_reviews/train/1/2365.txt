“Skips” sounds like a used speaker that is blown and I just received it today. Barely have the volume up as my kids are sleeping and it is by far the worst speaker. Super disappointed in JBL right now. My last JBL was amazing.Update - I returned the original speaker and received a replacement- the replacement is the exact same way and it also doesn’t stay connected to my phone the way it should. I wouldn’t buy from this “company”. Not sure if they are knock off speakers or what but any other JBL that I have purchased in the past from actual stores, I never had issues with. Very disappointing.
