Bought a set of these in august, the one I’ve been using at home is already starting to separate at the phone connection point. They charge well and are priced decently but durability is lacking, I’ve purchased a lot of these cheaper chargers over the years and don’t think I’ve had one break yet, usually just end up losing them. This one though is starting to separate at the phone plug in after only 3 months and it’s not even every day use. I use this charger about 3x a week because my work requires me to be away from home the rest of the time. Expected better to be honest.
