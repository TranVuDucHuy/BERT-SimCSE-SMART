The item arrived with wear and tear. I tried turning them on but they didn’t turn on. I decided to charge them and after charging them for several hours they still didn’t turn on. I was super disappointed, I thought Rode and Amazon were reliable. Please check who your getting your supplies from, it seems this might have been returned and weren’t checked to see if they even worked.
