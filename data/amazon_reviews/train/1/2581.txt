I received these and after thinking it was a glitch one day, but it turned into every single day. I have to tape down the volume controller *no clue why, this is the only way to fix it* because it wouldn't play sound! I was past my return by just a few days. I had my leg shattered and had surgery so I wasn't able to ask for a replacement in time. Totally sucks, but If they would of done a replacement, you can bet I'd of left a great review, until then it's staying and these SUCK!
