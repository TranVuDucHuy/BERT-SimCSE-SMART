Got this as an external mic so that I close the lids on my mac while on zoom (Mac auto turns off onboard microphone when you close the lid for privacy reasons I guess).Anyways, I have had it for a bit, it was pretty good for the first few month. Then all the sudden while I was in the middle of a zoom, the mic turned me into a stutter machine. after that, it worked on and off for a few more days until finally given out... and I threw it into the Garbage. That was a few month ago, I forgot about it until I recently bought a new replacement and thought to leave a review.for all of those who are looking to make a purchase, make sure to buy one with removable cable that connects to the computer, that way, if it stops working and if the problem is the cable you can replace the cable rather than the whole thing.
