I purchased the speaker in April from Amazon and it worked just fine on the factory charge which just ran out this week (early July). I loved the speaker. But now when I went to charge it the charge light only comes on when the on switch is pressed and then goes off after a short period of time. So, it won't fully charge. Even though my phone said it was 20% charged, the speaker shut off after only about a half hour of use. I've repeated this procedure several times. I'd like to return it for exchange (maybe it's just a "lemon"), but I don't see that option on the Amazon page.
