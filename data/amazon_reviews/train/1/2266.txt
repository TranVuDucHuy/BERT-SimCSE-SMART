One star until I get this resolved. So far this mic is not being recognized by my iPad, despite using a powered hub and lighting connection cable. Nowhere in the user manual are iPads or iPhones mentioned. I have seen answers to questions regarding this microphone and the ability to use with an iPad, and many times the answer has been “yes” or “it should.” I am really disappointed because I spent 150$ on a mic that “should” be able to work on my iPad, but have had no luck.As far as the sound quality - it’s great. Unfortunately I fear I may have to go through the dreaded returning process due to the microphone’s inability to connect to my ipad or my iphone. 😔
