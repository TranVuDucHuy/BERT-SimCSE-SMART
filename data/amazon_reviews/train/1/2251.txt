Good overall headset, but for a battery-powered product in a "charging case" there is a pretty big flaw:When the headset is in the charging case unused over the course of a weekend it will show "full - 3 blue lights" on the case when you tap the button, but upon being switched in the headset will immediately indicate that the battery is "critical" and I have to charge put it back into the case for it be begin charging from empty. So if you were planning on using it for a conference call first thing Monday, you will have to plug it in or use another headset.Using it throughout the week is fine, but this is a pretty big flaw in my opinion. Until I get a resolution form Poly via a firmware update or replacement hardware I will leave it at one star overall.EDIT: Upon registration of the serial number for warranty service I see the serial number shows "prior return"I bought this unit from this listing as a NEW device, not a refurbished one. They are selling defective units as new.UPDATE: They sent me another refurbished headset. Leaving one star because I never got what I ordered (a new headset)
