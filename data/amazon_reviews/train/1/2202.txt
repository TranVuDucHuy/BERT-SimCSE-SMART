It seemed like a good idea to buy this since most of the reviews were positive. At first, it's nice to see what they give you. You plug it in and it works. Unfortunately after now exactly 3 months its a dud. It has overwhelming static in whatever USB port I use on my pc. I've unplugged it and restarted my pc and it's still overwhelming static. It was fine before and I barely use this. Maybe a few times a week. This is very disappointing. I know for $40 it's not a Blue Yeti but not even 3 months with it being used maybe 4-6 hrs a week? That's terrible quality. So now I'm just going to buy the Blue Yeti like I should've done in the first place. Don't bother cheating out, its not worth it.Also, the sound quality wasn't that great unless you have it to your face with the included tripod in the box is absolutely useless because it just picks up every keystroke from my cherry red switches or from my PC fans. Over all this product isn't worth it. Spend the real money on a real mic. I'm not going to bother with a warranty return because I don't want to have to deal with this every 3 months and the quality isn't worth the time it would take to wait for the new mic.
