After reading some of the reviews of this microphone I had high hopes for it, especially at it's high price point, and the fact that I previously used a Blue Snowball, and many people were comparing this to Blue's microphones and praising it. I'm not sure what microphone they received, but my experience was very different.When I first plugged mine in the recording was extremely quiet, even when I spoke less than 4 in. away I could barely hear it on my computers max volume setting. Now, I know windows sometimes screws with sound settings, so I altered the default settings, to make it sound a little louder and increase the bit-rate. But even after that the microphone sounded extremely tinny and somewhat echoey, it sounded very much like what I imagine speaking into a tin can would sound like. Also, the stand seemed to be extremely good at transferring vibrations from my table, because somehow the sounds of me tapping my table or setting a plastic bottle on it sounded even louder than my own voice did. For $120 I was expecting much better sound quality, while this sounded more like a mic you'd get on a $10 headset.
