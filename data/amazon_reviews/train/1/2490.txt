The primary issue with these headphones was unstable connection to Bluetooth. I gave them two tries resetting both the headphones and the device that they were connected to with the same results. I was mainly going to use them for running but the audio kept skipping and it was so bad that I turned to the headphones off on both of the attempted runs. I do not recommend these headphones for runners.
