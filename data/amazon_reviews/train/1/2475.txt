I have never used an ear buds cleaning pen before. The box had no instructions in it, but they were on the back of the box. What a effective place to put a label! Not sure how I am supposed to use this.Suggestion: For those of us not bright enough to figure out how to use the product (I may be the only goofball in that cattegory), could you please either include instructions or not cover them up? Of course, I can Google the info, but I should not have to do that.
