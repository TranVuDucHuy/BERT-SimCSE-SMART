Unlike in product photos, the label on this SD card claims a 120mb/s transfer speed (no such product exists, should say 80mb/s.) Label print quality is far lower than any legitimate cards I've gotten, the finish is not shiny and the red ink bleeds onto the silver. When testing transfer speeds on my laptop the highest transfer speed I was able to get was 33mb/s, while my legitimate 128GB Ultra card gets a consistent 80mb/s, matching its claimed speed. This is clearly a fake card with cheap, low quality flash storage. Avoid this listing and any others from 3rd party sellers, either buy one shipped AND sold by Amazon or from Western Digital directly. Lesson learned.
