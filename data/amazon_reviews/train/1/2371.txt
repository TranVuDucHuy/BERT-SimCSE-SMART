I was amazed by the sound quality of this speaker the first time I used it. However, I couldn't get it to turn on again after that. It would not even charge. I tried every recommendation I found on the internet, but nothing worked. I live outside of the US, so I had to pay about 57 USD to return the speaker to Amazon. I'm supposed to get back 20 USD once it arrives at Amazon returns, but that's still 37 USD spent on a faulty product. Disappointed.
