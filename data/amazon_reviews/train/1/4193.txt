I was looking for a cost effective alternative pen to use on my iPad. This item worked right out of the box, which was great! The issues I have are:- The pen turns off VERY frequently while actively being used. I have to continually keep turning it back on in the midst of projects.- The charge on the pen does NOT last longer than perhaps an hour of usage, if that, even after several hours of charging, as recommended. I am constantly having to recharge.VERY AGGRAVATING little details that compel me to write this less than stellar review. ðŸ˜•
