So first off I've used Plantronics Legend headsets for many many years, replacing as the batteries didn't hold charge. Always been a fan of Plantronics headsets.I've had the Voyager 5200 UC for a month or so and am severely disappointed in this piece of hardware. Reasons as follows:-The dual material design, rubber-esque and hard plastic, have 'sharp' edges where the two materials meet. Not nearly as comfortable as the Legend.-The micro USB charging port on the bottom is SUPER convenient for charging without proprietary adapters, but there's zero reason why this can't be designed into the Voyager Legend as well.-The UC bluetooth adapter is larger, with a more annoying and less informative light, has no better range or benefit from the Legend UC adapter.-If paired with both the UC adapter/laptop and a phone, the Voyager Legend could be manually switched between the two audio devices with the press of the main button. The 5200, however, has no such feature that I've been able to discover. When listening to audio from the computer, ANY audio coming from the phone (email notification, charging notification, or even the phone just being ON playing a game with all sound disabled) disrupts sound from the computer for the duration.-There's zero reason why the Legend and 5200 can't use the same earpieces. They're designed juuuust differently enough so they aren't interchangeable. If you have extra earpieces from one as you move to the other, you're just S.O.L.-Feels like a cheap Chinese knockoff. Between the two-material junction and even the motion of rotating the mic boom, definitely does NOT feel like a $150 headset.So very disappointed that I saved and spent all my Christmas and Birthday Amazon gift cards on this headset that I genuinely dislike.
