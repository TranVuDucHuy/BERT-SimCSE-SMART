I have recently bought a brand new microphone - Shure SM7B, a new audio interface Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 3rd Gen, and Cloudlifter CL-1I have connected them, downloaded the drivers needed for the audio interface and all and proceeded to test the mic. It was not giving any sound. After a few researches I have decided to try and connect the mic straight to the Audio Interface, and everything is working. The mic gives sound, and the interface is working good.Few things I have tried to troubleshoot the issue:I have tried to connect both of the XLR cables, they both work fine (they are also brand new).I did turn on the Phantom Power (48V).I turned it on in the Focusrite App on windows. I have tried without it.I have tried to connect the audio interface to a different USB. I have made sure the USB is connected to USB 3.Nothing seem to work and I came to conclusion that the CL is just faulty.I hoped for a replacement or a refund to order a new one. No answer from the seller for more than a week, and still no answer.Be careful buying, RitzCamera is the supplier/buyer.
