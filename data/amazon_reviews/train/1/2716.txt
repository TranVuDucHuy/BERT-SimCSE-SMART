The Shure SM57 has a great reputation, but I think that reputation is based solely on its ubiquity and history. The unit I received has a very loose end cap -- the screen on the end -- such that one touch during recording will cause massive overload since the preamp gain has to be pretty high unless you happen to be mic'ing a really loud guitar cabinet. That makes it useless for pretty much every other purpose, e.g. vocal, acoustic instruments (especially guitar where it could be bumped by the musician's hand).In short, I just don't see it as the once "go to" mic for so many applications. There are much better options. Not worth $100.
