This item is a piece of junk. Sound quality terrible. May be OK for instruments but not voice. Not even an on-off switch. Wish I had retuned it right away. Kept giving it a try but it didn't get better. My stupidity for even trying. Shure should be ashamed of themselves for even selling this low quality mic. Buyer be ware.
