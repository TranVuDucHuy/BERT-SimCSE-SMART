I hate that I purchased this item. I did on Sept. 16, 2022 received it Sept. 22. The charger started getting hot and stopped working on Nov. 21st. I started using the other one the same day, it stopped working today Feb.10, 2023 not even a full 5 months. I'd like a replacement. It looks like the company is no longer in business. I've gotta be very careful about shopping on Amazon for certain products. May do better on WISH.
