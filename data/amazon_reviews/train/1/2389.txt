I do the sound at a local venue with a state of the art sound system. I needed 2 cheap wireless mics for a comedy show and took a chance on these. The mics had a strong bass emphasis. I could have EQâ€™d that away, but one of the mic emitted a whining sound. I tried all frequencies but could not make that go away. I returned the set and ordered a Phenyx wireless set for the same price. The Phenyx mics have flatter, clearer response. And they made no noise. I would recommend those mics over these. These were unusable in a professional room.
