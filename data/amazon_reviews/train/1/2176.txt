I used it on my windshield. I followed the directions and used the very, very, tiny wet and dry pads they send with it. They are about the size of a postage stamp. No I’m not kidding. I applied it to the windshield and within a half hour it fell off. If I could give it less than one star I would. I discovered that quad lock came out with a magnetic wireless charging head, so I ordered that. I’m going back to something that actually works. Not this piece of useless garbage.
