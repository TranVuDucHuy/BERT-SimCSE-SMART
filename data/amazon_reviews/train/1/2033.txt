So this holder, in theory, seemed perfect. However, the vent holder prongs are built too far apart to work on my Toyota Sequoia vents. The prongs are somewhat bendable, but they won't bend enough to reach the two needed vent clips. Not worth trying to will my vents to bend in a ridiculous manner to fit a $10 phone holder. I'm sure it works great for most cars, just not mine. I did see that someone with a Toyota Hylander had the same issue, but ended up breaking their vent tabs, so maybe Toyota vents are spaced differently than this mount is designed for or maybe they are too rigid and don't bend enough. Either way, if you have a Toyota, I would look for a different phone mount. Mine will have to be returned.
