I spend a fair amount of time researching and reviewing models and found a great deal on the PT D-600 Business ... supposedly ... with a case. The case was a very big factor in my decision. Today - I received the label maker without a case. I called Brother and they said there is no case for this machine. I tried repeating my search steps and looking at my order details for the machine and I can find NOTHING about the one I ordered. There were 4 options on the one page and I chose the $99 610 (newer version). It CLEARLY showed and stated a case was include. I will not even use the label maker for the sake of principle. I am returning it.
