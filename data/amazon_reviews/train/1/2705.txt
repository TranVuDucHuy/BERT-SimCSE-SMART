The remote was suspect when I tested it at home. Wouldn't turn on but after multiple attempts it started to work. I tested it out again few hrs later and worked fine. Brought it to Iceland (reason for purchase) tested it out at the airport only for it to not work again. Now I'm in iceland with no selfie stick. 1 star for defective product. If it did work, the functionality of the product is decent.
