I purchased these in Aug 2022 and they were broken by Sept 2022. Just after the 30 days return. They do not have noise cancelling. The battery doesn't last long, and if you leave them outside the case they die quickly. Other headphone fully turn off when not in use. The main problem is the case, you need the case to pair them initially, and they have no way of turning off when not in the case. Not my case is broken. The buds still connect and even charge, but since the case is broken, the buds are useless.
