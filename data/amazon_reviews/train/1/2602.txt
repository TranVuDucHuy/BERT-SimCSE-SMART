I am obsessed with karaoke and was excited to purchase this microphone, after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I am highly disappointed with this karaoke microphone. I don't recommend it to anyone. Long details below.When I received it (bought as new), I noticed my box was already opened. It felt as if it was a used item. Inside, the two wires (usb and audio wires) were undone and thrown inside the carrying case along with their ziploc style bag. It came with one black protective foam. It was unusable since it had a huge rip in it. The customer support and Bonaok advertising sticker looked to have been crumpled up then replaced inside the carrying case.The microphone itself was very dirty. I was appalled to have found what look like hair clippings stuck on the base of the "functions" deck. I had thought that maybe the hairlike clippings were from the damaged foam cover. (Which it wasn't T.T) The mic gave off a potent dirty musky smell. I decided to clean it but the scent was still there or just embedded into my nose now.I tested it out with Smule and my voice barely registered in the recording. I sounded like I was singing through a can. The speaker portion of the mic was weak as well. I even raised up the volume to max and you can hardly hear anything.I was going to check and see if maybe the battery was corroded but there was a sticker on the hatch by this time, I had enough. I didn't want to have to remove the sticker and leave the sticker residue on it. I felt I gave this microphone way too many chances and had finally had enough and decided to send it back for a refund.
