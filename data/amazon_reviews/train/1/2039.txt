It's a lemon, I recommend not buying. You might get luckier than me, but 2 of these have failed to meet the basic requirements of a phone bluetooth headset - the mic fails to work consistently.I bought one of these and had to return immediately because no one could hear me when I called them (though I could hear them - that part works fine).The next one I got worked for a while and then about a month after I had it, the mic volume started fading randomly - i'd call someone and could hear them and they could hear me. Then they started not being able to hear me as well (stuttering or low volume) even though i could still hear them fine. I tried resetting (amazon customer service helped me w/steps). But after resetting, it quickly goes back to being a problem.Not a battery problem - it's been fully or close to fully charged before all of the failures.As a pure music player (if you just want to listen to your phone's music), it'll do an ok job (no stereo of course).Too late to return it and I'm tired of trying workarounds. I'm looking around for another bluetooth headset manufacturer....
