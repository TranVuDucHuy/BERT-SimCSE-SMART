This item will not connect to my Samsung Fold 3's Bluetooth. I made numerous attempts to reach the company to see if there was some other way to make this work. I have yet to get a response. I found an old phone of mind that it did connect to. However, my purpose for getting this is to use it when I am in my wife's vehicle or sitting in my backyard. I shouldn't have to pull out my old phone that I NO LONGER USE to use this item. GET IT TOGETHER AND RESPOND TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!!
