And now the Bluetooth toggle no longer will recharge! I was only able to recharge it ONCE! Now the red light goes on but cuts out after about 30 seconds and will not charge. Without this toggle the stick is basically worthless. Try expanding the stick to even half length and see it your arm can reach it â€”- mine cannot. It also renders putting this on tripod and trying to click a picture - impossible! I will have to buy another unit but definitely from a different vendor. Waste of money.
