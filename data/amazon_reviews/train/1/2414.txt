I originally bought this product as a replacement cable for my WD External HD, but when I first plugged it into my MacBook, it continued to disconnect before I could put it to use. I tried different adapters, and even other laptops with USB-A ports, and they wouldn't even recognize the device. So I ended up purchasing the same type of cable from a local electronics store, and have had no issues with that one. I may have just received a defective cable from Amazon, but it is absolutely useless to me now.
