This charger isn’t worth spending your money on. Ever since I’ve gotten it, I’ve always ended up having to unplug it and plug it again for it to charge, which is very annoying. Do not buy this off-brand sorry excuse for an iPhone charger. Unplugging it and plugging it again can get very infuriating if it doesn’t charge. I do NOT recommend this product. They probably knew these chargers were defective, because they’re not allowing product returns.
