When it works, it works fine, but since I initially got this it has always had regular intermittent drop-outs of both audio and video. It was my first attempt at a hookup like this so I lived with it for a while but eventually it just was too distracting and drove me crazy.After a lot of troubleshooting I was able to isolate that it wasn't an issue with my AVR/TV or the media player on my iMac (which never hiccupped while being mirrored; the external feed always did). After reading some other reviews I just went over to Target and got a $20 adapter from Philips to see if the adapter was the problem. Yep. The Philips fits tight and snug and there's no more hiccupping. A much nicer solution than me thinking I might need a newer/faster machine (although mine is still pretty powerful even with several years on it) or to have a machine with a direct HDMI connection so I wouldn't have to use an adapter.Sometimes build quality doesn't matter as much with little adapters and bits and bobs... but this is an example of one where you get what you pay for.
