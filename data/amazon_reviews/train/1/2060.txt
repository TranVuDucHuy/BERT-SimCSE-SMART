I loved my buds until I damaged them. My fault not to Google or anyone. But contacting and getting anything accomplished with their support team is non existent.They like to jerk you around with "specialist" but each time you have to WAIT on them to reach out. "A new specialist will reach you within a day" then no one will ever each out to you. So you send a message to the previous specialist, "I can confirm that they will reach out to you within a day" it has been a few days of this bs. You have to keep on th or they will hope that you forget and get a new pair? I don't know their motive, just not helpful
