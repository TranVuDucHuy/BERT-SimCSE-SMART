I suppose with any additional connector between your sound output and your speaker sets, you risk more resistance on the wire, thus lower quality wires (i.e. this splitter) will cause greater reduction in sound quality volume. However this splitter reduces too much, it becomes unacceptable, the highs are lost and the lows are not present. Additionally, similar to another reviewer, the volume after it passes through this splitter becomes too low.I'm guessing all these issues are due to the quality of the material it is made of, thus I'd advise to avoid. You get what you paid for.
