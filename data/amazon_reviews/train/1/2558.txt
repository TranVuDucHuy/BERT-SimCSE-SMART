While it worked it was pretty okay. Sound is fairly good for the price, fit is decent, and the magnets keeping the headphones in the case is surprisingly good. But it has some downsides. When turning them on by opening the case, it loves to connect and disconnect then reconnect. Most of the time it will do this only once, but it has gone through two of the disconnect reconnect cycles before settling and remaining connected three times in my one month of ownership.I was willing to accept this, but then I rebooted my phone while one headphone was connected and now that headphone will no longer output sound. I've done all the troubleshooting procedures and re-paired it a few times, but that one side still doesn't produce sound.The battery life is okay, but doesn't reach anywhere near the 100 hours proclaimed. I get maybe 15-20 hours out of one charge. It's also lacking in features, such as volume up/down and previous track.Not something that affected the rating, but don't expect to be able to sleep on your side with these in. They are not comfortable when pressing against the pillow and the ear and the two times I managed to fall asleep with them in, they came out throughout the night.
