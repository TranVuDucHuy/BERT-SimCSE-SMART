- After 2 weeks of use I have started to notice a high pitch noise when the speaker is connected to any device (laptop, phone..). This noise is not noticeable when a song or movie is playing at 30% volume or above+ Sound quality is good at half volume;+ speaker is loud enough for my needs.+ the multifunction one button on the speaker is a useful addition.+ battery ok+ disappointed with the high pitch noise
