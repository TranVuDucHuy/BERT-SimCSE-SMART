Had trouble connecting from the beginning. Finally got them connected and they worked ok. The range isn't great if you walk out of the room, starts cutting in and out a lot. The battery life isn't very good, maybe 3 hours tops. Now, after about a month, I can't even get them to connect to my phone. One positive, they fit my ear pretty wellUPDATE: these earbuds are frustrating. Won't automatically connect to my phone, unless I reset them often, cut out a lot when only a few feet from my phone. I know they were cheap, but I at least hoped they would work. DEFINITELY not a "go to" setUPDATE 2: I keep hoping these will eventually work as I expect ... nope. It continually disconnects in the middle of a phone call, then reconnects, over and over. Every few weeks I get a "Problem connecting" notice on my phone. Have to reset and re-pair them. They NEVER connect on the initial time, and sometimes not after multiple times. I have given up on them for the moment, will try again tomorrow. These are just about to go in the trash. I recommend TOZO earbuds, I have had almost 0 problems with those. These Flybuds are mostly junk
