Plugged it in to charge it. After about 3 minutes the Red LED went out indicating it was fully charged. Plugged a USB stick into it. Held the On/Off button, it makes a noise, then the Blue LED starts blinking. No play. Shut it off and another noise. No matter how long or short I hold the power button it starts the blinking Blue LED. I can't get it to not blink no matter what I do or how long I hold buttons. It will not play, it will not do anything but blink the Blue LED. I have tried every conceivable combination of buttons and hold times to try and get this unit to work. I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO WASTE ON JUNK! The junk is going back!It says Connective Technology Bluetooth, USB. There is no connection with the USB port except to charge it. Very Misleading.
