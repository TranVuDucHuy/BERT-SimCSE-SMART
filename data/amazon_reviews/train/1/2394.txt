I can get to about 1/3 gain on my apollo x4 before I'm hearing all kinds of noises. I decided to just detach this from the line and just go straight into my interface, and now I get really clean signal. I had read a lot of reviews that said you needed this lifter if you were using the sm7b, but that's totally dependent on your interface. On the focusrite, I do believe you'll need a lifter, but my friend got a fethead and that seems to be working perfectly for him. On an apollo, I still have about 1/6 of the way to go on my gain, and it still sounds amazing. This was a total waste of money, and I didn't find out until I started actively listening to play back in logic. Can't believe this hasn't been stated more, but definitely don't pay 150 for this all metal body paper weight.
