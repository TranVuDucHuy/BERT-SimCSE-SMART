Update: Changed to a zero star. Support is via email in badly translated English (from Chinese, I assume). For a simple driver error, they took weeks to suggest reinstalling my O/S!! I've worked in tech support for years and this is the WORST "support" ever!! Shame.Bought this for work. Use it to connect to my laptop for online meetings and IP phone. Worked great until yesterday when one of the drivers failed and the microphone stopped working. I reached out to New Bee support with details on the driver that failed, the error message, my OS version info and the behavior of the earpiece. The reply was, "Please tell us the detailed problems you encountered. What does the driver error mean?" I mean, if support doesn't understand a driver error from the detailed description, I don't know how to explain it to them...Otherwise, it has been amazing! Great battery live, connection and sound quality.
