This came in with the metal bit that holds up the pole broken, ie it will not hold the pole up, it just slides back down, and from what I can tell, I’m just out 35 bucks since it doesn’t seem to be returnable. Really shoddy construction - for the cost you can pay 50 more and get something reliable, sturdy and from a reputable brand who will fix issues when they arise with their products. Would not recommend - try another brand.
