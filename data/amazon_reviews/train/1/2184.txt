When charging my phone, they can't handle the current they pass, and overheat. When they overheat, they have a thermal protection feature that shuts them off until they cool a little. This is good to prevent a fire but it's annoying as f@&k because the phone screen comes on when the charger shuts off. It only takes a second or two of being off to cool enough to start charging again. Especially annoying in the dark. The charge cycle goes like this: 1. Start charging when phone is near zero. 2. When the phone gets to about 35%, the screen lights up for a few seconds. 3. The screen goes dark again but comes back on for a few seconds every few minutes. 4. By the time the battery gets near 70%, the current draw is low enough that the charger no longer overheats and the flashing stops. I've had the same results with all four chargers in the pack and with three different phones. These chargers will work fine for you if you are charging a device that doesn't draw a lot of power, but a fast charging phone will make them overheat. My phone is a Galaxy S21.
