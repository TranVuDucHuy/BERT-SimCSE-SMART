I bought 2 of these and spent a lot of time trying to get them set up for my daughter and mother in law. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I passed it along to my husband and sure enough they just didn't work. The instructions are different that what's on the screen. The app that goes with the frame is different than indicated as well. Has good potential but poorly executed. It says you can choose your language but it randomly starts playing a video in a different language. I tried factory reset as well, no luck. I finally got one to ask me what language so I selected English and it still would play a video with a different language and I couldn't read it, it was a language with symbols/characters not letters. I could understand that if it was made in that country, no problem but I shouldn't just randomly play. It was just an interesting experience and a disappointment overall. I was looking forward to gifting these frames.
