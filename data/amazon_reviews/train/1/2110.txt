I really liked this light because of the variety of brightness and the different ways you can set it up. This morning I turned it on and it started to flickering like a strobe light! I can't use it on my online meetings anymore because you can see it flashing. The window for returning closed 6 days ago! For $40, I would expect this to last at least a year!
