The "earbuds" inside the headband are huge. Larger in circumference than a quarter and about 2 quarters thick, with flimsy, unanchored wires. The buds slide all over the place inside the band. This required me to constantly adjust them, which made me neurotic, lol. Additionally, plugging it in to charge is practically a 2-person job, because you need 2 hands just to hold open the tiny rectangle of stretchy fabric that covers the charging port. Even then, it's very difficult to not catch a bit of the fabric while plugging it in. If you don't notice, you'll come back later to an uncharged headset. That problem might be mitigated if the charging indicator light could be seen, but the hole in the fabric that it should shine through is very small and poorly placed, so you have to tediously dig it out from under the fabric to see it. The buttons to control power and volume are on your forehead, if the band is worn properly. They're rubber and located next to rubber bumps that don't do anything, so feeling around to find actual buttons (without the benefit of vision) becomes tiresome very quickly. Now, after just a couple of months, it won't charge at all. The whole thing is a mess. So bad.
