I've now ordered 3 different S Pen Fold editions and all three have snapped at the tip leaving the insert inside the pen so it cannot be removed and replaced. Now Amazon is giving me grief because I want to replace the broken pen I received. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Samsung must get this fixed. The first one I bought directly from Samsung, after it broke, told me they were sold out as a company of the pen. But that translated into they didn't have the right style number and didn't want my help in identifying it. And when it did work, it was intermittent at best and couldn't identify most words at all so I ended up using the swipe through feature instead. If my hands weren't so big, I'd go without them but it's even more difficult. Take your chances but when it happens to you... I'm gonna say "told ya so."
