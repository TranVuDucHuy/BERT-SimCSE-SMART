The first one was an honest mistake, so I returned it and ordered another one, but that one also didn't have the car lighter adapter that they show in every picture and state multiple times. The box that gets shipped doesn't mention the adaptor, so something deceitful is happening here. I ended up just ordering another way, a cheaper brand.
