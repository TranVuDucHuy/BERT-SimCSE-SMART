I tested my microphone (a Rode lavalier) with and without the splitter. It works fine with my phone, my iPad, and my computer BY ITSELF.The speaker works OK with the splitter.THE MICROPHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH THIS SPLITTER.The maker does not specify what kind of microphone actually works with this product.Returned for a refund.
