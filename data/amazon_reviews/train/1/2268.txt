I didn't think much of it when opening the box. The excited inner child in me just hooked it up right away and wanted to test it. Well, I did. Through my phantom power supply and it was sounding great. But then, it doesn't. The volume is suuuuper low so I decide to look up more videos on the mic and how it interacts with phantom power. I come to realize my unboxing experience is very different from what I find others have unboxed. Mine came with some Tisino brand XLR to USB cable, cool I guess. But missing the instructions, protective layering around the mic itself and another sheet inside the box. So now I am unsure if the product o received was even "new". And also, if the volume issues I was having with it are because of the mic or another source? If the mic was new, I shouldn't have issues with it. But don't want to go out of my way to buy other products in case the actual issue IS the mic.I did contact Amazon support and they confirmed the product was new.... Supposedly.
