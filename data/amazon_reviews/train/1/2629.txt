I purchased this to store videos and play it on the car DVD player. First warning sign is that it takes to long to copy the file to the card then when I play the video on my player, it would skip or stop for slit second before continuing.I tested the card with CrystalDiskMark and it shows that Max read is only at 20MB/s which is way below the 80MB as advertised. When I do a copy, the status is only showing 4MB/s as average speed. Read speed shows at 17MB/s but continues drops to 2MBs.I tested by reformatting my video from 720p to 320 x 240 and it performs a lot better. So the read speed is way low and cannot keep-up with larger files.I am not sure if I got a defective card or a fake card. Some reviewers seem to be getting 95MBs on their tests. If I still have the packaging I will return this item. Too bad that I trusted this brand that I toss the package in the recycle bin right away.
