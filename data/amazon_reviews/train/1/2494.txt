The s pen itself is a good product no issues with it itself. The issue was with me trying to insert the tip in its slot.All the parts were in their correct place. Pic 1 shows the way the s pen was in the package. I wasn't aware that the tip had snap/broke of the stem. When I try to insert the two of tip in and you can see the damage done to both tips in Pic 2. A friend of mine knew what the problem was, and was able to help me since she seen this before, and you can see that in Pic 3 and how she was able to remove the stem from the s pen.The S pen is good. I at this time can not recomment the Seller nor will I buy from them again. If I can give them a Zero score I would. This should have not happened.
