This holder slipped down my 13 year old sonâ€™s finger (hole in the back) as he carried it. His finger swelled up almost immediately, turning purple as we tried ice and oil to remove the holder from his hand. We had to go to the ER and have two doctors work for his finger to be removed from the cell phone holder.The design should be changed so that a finger can not fit through any parts on this holder.
