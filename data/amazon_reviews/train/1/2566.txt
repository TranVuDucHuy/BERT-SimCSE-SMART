edit from past 3 star, now 1 star:These suck. Theyre awful. I spend nonstop time adusting them or picking them off the dirty ground-they WILL NOT stay in my ears. At all. Not for a second sitting completely still. Yes, i tried every size in each ear. Complete waste of money.Had another set of tozo and lost one so i quick ordered these. The sound is quite decent, like the last pair, not too tinny and ok bass. The shape. The shape of it all. Whyyyyyyy are these so bulbous?! I spend 99% of the time adjusting these. They fall out to the ground constantly. I have tried all the diff sizes of the bud caps and tried many diff ways but these shift nonstop. They fit inside my ear and cancel sound fine. Its simply they are so bulbous. They rub on my hat too and so are triggered to pause a lot, or pause every time i adjust. I want to like these and maybe i would if i had gotten them to wear sitting absolutely still, but these are not for walking or even mild movement. Stupid ass design. Waste of money for me.
