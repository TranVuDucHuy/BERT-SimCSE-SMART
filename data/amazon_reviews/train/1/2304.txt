Purchased this item to connect to a 2.5" SATA drive. Plugged the cable adapter into drive and my laptop. A dull orange light came on but the drive did not enumerate. Reading some more it seems that cable adapter only powers 900mA whereas my drive requires 1800mA. That is my fault for not reading the fine print.But that is not the most annoying part. I initiated a return/replacement and this product is not eligible for return. As best as I can tell the item is not eligible for return because it does not have a serial number printed on the cable adapter. I now have a worthless $11 cable that will occupy my junk drawer.
