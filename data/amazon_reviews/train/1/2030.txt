Absolute garbage. Not even because of cheap quality, overall. Bought only because of a lot of positive reviews but i cant understand them. Maybe on cheap 1000$ car it will work fine, but on good newer bmw its could make damage. Now i need to replace vents. I was doing uber and lyft a lot, selling cars, i drove plenty of cars and used different vent mounts but this one the worst ever. I never got vent broken ever in my life. Even on same bmw with different vent holder. I sold my second car and forgot mine vent holder there(cant find mine anywhere online) and bought this one because of reviews. But its not real like it said. When i originally put my phone there, when you press and type something on the phone, its go up and down, its not steady at all. I changed a few different positions and found that my vent got crack after that, so i put it another place. I m driving by gps so i was about to order something else later but today that happened. I was at gas station and was about to pull my phone with 2 hands. And this came out with went in it. So it originally damaged one vent, and then another... I was trying to put it back and its completely broken, because it was already crack on top after first use. I was using small iphone xr and that happened.Now i supposed to pay more than 300$ to replace vents... Dont buy it, not recommend. First negative review on amazon
