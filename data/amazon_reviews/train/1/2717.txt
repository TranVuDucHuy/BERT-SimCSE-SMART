I don't know how this microphone has such a good review same thing with the 58 I got these around Christmas and weather I connected them to my tower speakers or my midi it didn't matter I just heard a brief pop when I connected and then nothing it didn't matter if I screamed through the microphone it didn't work. I use these cables every day with my cheaper microphones with no problems I just don't understand how it doesn't work with these microphones. Any help would be appreciated as I am now returning these for the second time.
