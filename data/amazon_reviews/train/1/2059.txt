Update: These headphones are exactly one month old. They don't even last 4 hours on a full charge. Ugh, do not recommend. Switching back to my old earbuds yet again so these can charge .... ughThese sound way better than my other earbuds. The bass is satisfying. Most Bluetooth earbuds have little to no bass.They also integrate with Android pretty nicely if you get the app. It can read your notifications and shows each earbuds battery life when you plug it in.Buuut...Can't shut these off. That's my main complaint. So you have to carry the case around else just waste battery life carrying these in your pockets or whatever.The battery life is awful and has been from day 1. Least battery life of all my Bluetooth headphones. Like 3-4 hours then they start beeping that they're low.Out of the box they pause if you remove an earbud which is really dumb if you like to keep just one in. But you can turn that off, though you need their app.Overall the quality is nice but they have too many drawbacks.
