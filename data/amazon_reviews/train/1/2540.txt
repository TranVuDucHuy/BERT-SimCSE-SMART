Headphones are less than 2 months old. Battery life, features, volume, fidelity are all awesome. Unfortunately the construction doesn't matter the same accolade.UPDATE: reached out to Amazon customer service. Headphones were purchased less than 2 months ago and, although the prime window for returning was passed, the manufacturers warranty is good for 2 years.ACS reached out to Sony on my behalf and included me on the call. Sony's customer service said that the warranty did not cover physical damage. I contested that it wasn't damaged but rather a defect and was told that it didn't matter in the rule still applied.After that call was terminated, the rep from Amazon went above and beyond to try and offer some partial resolution.Moral of the story is that Amazon customer service was stellar in this instance and will switch to tin cans attached to string before ever using Sony again.
