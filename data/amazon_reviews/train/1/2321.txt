I was excited because it seems like a sturdy headset and I wanted the ability to walk around more rather than being stuck at my desk all day long. An important feature on a headset is the mute button and this one is horrible. You have to press down both the + and the - at the same time to mute however when I try to unmute it gets stuck on mute. I needed him having to use my headphones with the cord attached because of this reason. I’ll be returning and buying a new set with what seems to be a much better mute function. I’d spend the extra money and get a more reliable headset because you’ll more than likely have to return it anyways. And this was not user error I followed the manual instructions to a T.
