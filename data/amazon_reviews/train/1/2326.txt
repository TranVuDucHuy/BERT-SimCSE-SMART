I ordered this prodict based on several online reviews & a youtube review. Seemed great. WRONG. This is a POS. To be more specific, it does work great for about 2-3 weeks, then begins malfunctioning, and will no longer pair with any device. I am tech savvy, and have owned and used bluetooth devices for decades. So, it's not an issue of me not knowing what I'm doing. As noted, it actually worked great for about 2-3 weeks. And I loved it. But then, suddenly, it began periodically dropping the bluetooth signal and disconnecting and/or connecting only after multiole tries. Eventually, it stopped working altogether and would no longer connect to any bluetooth devices. I tried it with 3 different iphones just to make sure it wasn't the iphone: two iphone 6s and one iphone 12. All three working perfectly with other bluetooth devices. It was definitely the ATUMTEK bluetooth control. What a POS. Buy something else. The stick is sturdy and well-balanced, I'll give it that. But what are you gonna do with just s stick? The control = not sturdy at all, apparently, because it stopped working.
