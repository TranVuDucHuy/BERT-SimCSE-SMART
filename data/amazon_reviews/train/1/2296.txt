The label printer works good enough and (provided you use the "chain" cut option), it doesn't waste tape in between labels.The integrated LCD display looks terrible, but it is serviceable, so I guess it works. They really should update the LCD screen to a better display.It's not as easy to type in the brother machine as in a regular keyboard, but that was expected given the lack of key travel and I'm not holding that against the machine. As-is, it's good for one-off labels. However, more complicated labels should be easier to type on the PC with a more confortable keyboard. Thus, that issue should have been offset by the PC software.However, I'll rate it one star due to the PC software. I've been unable to install the Windows 10 x64 driver on my PC, both using the overall installer as well as the independent driver installation (see images). It throws an "error 193", which (according to the Brother FAQ) means wrong version. However, I'm 100% certain that I downloaded the right version for my PC (checked 4 times).Attempting email support was fruitless; they sent me a generic "this is how you search for the driver on our web site", despite my messages clearly identifying that my problem was that the driver wasn't installing.
