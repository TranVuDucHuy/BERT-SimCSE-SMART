I had a handyman put it up, quite fast. After a week I went to peak for a button, it fell off the wall opened a hole on the drywall, and My tv didnt get ruined only because I had carpet on the floor, so it only hit the wall.Forget it, worst decision ever, saving a couple bucks cost me way more money. Now I also have to hire a handyman again!
