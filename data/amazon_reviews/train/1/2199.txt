I genuinely do not understand how this has so many positive reviews. This mic sucks. It doesn’t pick up any sound unless your mouth is literally pressed against it and even then, the quality is terrible. My built-in MacBook mic is more effective. Also, the mic stand is flimsy and there’s no way to tighten it, so the mic just kinda flops around. I tested it using multiple recording software programs AND on multiple computers (I initially thought it was an issue on my end) and nope, still garbage.
