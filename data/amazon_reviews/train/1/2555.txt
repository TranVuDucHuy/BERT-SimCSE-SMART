Everything was great the first month and a half. However, everything started to spiral downward after that. The one faulty feature that made it really inconvenient was that the ear pieces did not connect to my calls anymore even though the Bluetooth connection on my phone stated that they were. Anytime I receive a call now I would have to put my phone on speaker or disconnect the Bluetooth connection all together.In addition, the placement of the ear piece inside my ear started to lose traction which made it very difficult to exercise. Especially during high intensity workouts, it was not uncommon for one of the ear pieces to keep slipping out.When pausing songs and/or skipping to next tracks, I have to tap harder on the ear piece. Compared to when I first bought the set, all what was needed was a "feather" touch of the finger. Now, and as time goes by even more, I really have to bang my finger harder on the ear piece just for the songs to pause and skip to the next track. My ear drums have been taking quite a beating lately.I sure hope this manufacturing problem gets fixed during future production. I loved this product the first month and thought I would be holding on to this set for years. Now I'm back to the drawing board.
