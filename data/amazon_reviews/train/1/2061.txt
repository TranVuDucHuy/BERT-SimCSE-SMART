I loved these buds, yet it was only for two weeks. I've had JBL, Beats, Apple, and these. That said, the Google Buds we're by far the best..........However, my charger doesn't work, and I can't pair my new phone. If it did, hands down the best buds I've owned. It is important to note I have Apple Air too, but because my experience, buy something else. Due diligence.
