I originally bought these headphones for my daughter to use in school (kindergarten) back in Aug 2021. She seemed to like them so I bought another pair for her in October to use at home. Within 2 weeks the pair at home stopped working in her tablet. Ok, I thought, something wrong with the port on the tablet. So, we used them on my laptop and there was no issue... for another few weeks. Then we moved them to use on my desktop and they stopped working YET AGAIN by the end of the year.No problem, I am still within my return window for Amazon to provide a refund.Well, yesterday her school headphones were sent home WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE!!! Now I'm upset.It's one thing if she was using them more frequently like the ones ay home but she only uses her school set once a week for like an hour? Which is probably the ONLY reason they "lasted" as long as they did.I have contacted the manufacturer for the school pair as they are still within the one year warranty.I will update this review with how that refund/replacement is handled.As for now, I would NOT recommend these headphones to anyone.
