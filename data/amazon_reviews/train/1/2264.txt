Product is just not as advertised.To begin with:All instructions arrive in Chinese.The plastic microphone holder is very cheap and fragile, it's also packaged in a superfluous faux-leather pouch that had to increase cost of goods but provides no utility. The microphone holder will break VERY easily, handle with great care!It provides NO stand or ability to use the microphone as-is. Unless you have a screw top microphone tripod, you can't use the microphone as it cannot stand up properly on its own AT ALL, in one of the dumbest designs in history. The microphone is UNUSABLE as-is you MUST purchase additional items just to make the microphone stand up to receive sound.Then you finally plug in the microphone, download the drivers (I had to download mine manually) and then try it out AND....actually not much better AT ALL than just my regular laptop microphone! There is NO tone control, or mixing abilities at all and the sound is largely FLAT and the microphone must be very, very close to catch full sound. Adjusting recording volumes just creates hiss.IT'S JUNK. IT'S A TOY. IT'S NOT A SERIOUS PRODUCT. THE SOUND QUALITY IS LOUSY.Cheaply made, mass-produced and arrives largely unusable unless you buy other accessories. When trying to assess sound quality you have NO SUPPORT. No customer service line, no web site and all instructions in Chinese.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
