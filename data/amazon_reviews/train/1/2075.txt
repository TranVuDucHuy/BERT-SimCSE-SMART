Since I live on an island and can't just run to the store, I like to have a spare toner ready. In August, I ordered this genuine Brother toner because the last time I ordered the knock-off cheaper brands two out of three didn't work. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box yesterday when my printer finally ran out of ink, to find the framework for the cartridge but no toner cartridge! Too late to return, of course. Maybe I'm just fated to be in printer hell...
