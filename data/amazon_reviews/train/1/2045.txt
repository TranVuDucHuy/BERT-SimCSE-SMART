I do not need a fancy Bluetooth. I figured this would be okay for the price. I haven't had it 2 hours and SO ready to return. Where to start???? Okay, first off, it has a "toy" feeling to it. Not sturdy at all. Second, when you connect and turn it on, you have NO idea how much battery it has unless you actually go thru the Bluetooth settings on the phone. Third, it is difficult to adjust in the ear without pressing that cheap middle button which activates a redial function. It feels foreign in the ear. Just doesn't feel right. Fourth, I have 2 phones connected, that being said, when I walk away from one of the phones, it constantly says "disconnected" in my ear. If I am on another call and not near phone 2, it beeps the entire time while on call. My advice, spend a few more dollars and get a ore "user friendly" device. I tried to give this brand a shot as my other was lost and now went up double in price but I will be sending this back promptly and paying the extra money for a product I feel comfortable with and can trust.
