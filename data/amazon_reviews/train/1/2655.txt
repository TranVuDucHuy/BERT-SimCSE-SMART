I have previously bought 5 of these speakers because if the great sound and battery life and size.I should have looked at the picture of the latest one I bought. The one I received the volume was set at one level. It didn’t Have a memory card slot like the previous ones. All it gets is Bluetooth and cannot play my music like the others I purchased. I was so disappointed I threw it out. That’s ok, I have 3 of the good ones.
