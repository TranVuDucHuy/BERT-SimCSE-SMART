Sound and length of charge were great for about 3 months. Now the speaker will not charge and shuts itself off after a couple of minutes while plugged in. Speaker has been protected inside of a case, and only used at my desk at work. So no harsh elements or water damage. I don’t recommend purchasing this product unless you don’t mind throwing it away after a few months. I’m done with JBL.
