I picked these earbuds up back in July and have had nothing but issues. They refuse to power off when put back in the case. Meaning the earbuds are in a constant state of on causing the battery to drain and on more than one occasion they have been dead when I needed them. When I put them back in the case they refuse to charge further playing into the battery issues. My phone would randomly connect to them due to the earbuds powering on on their own causing me to miss alarms and calls. Sound quality was ok and fit was amazing they never fell out. On several occasions I had issues activating the sound profiles and awareness mode. Even after power cycling and the factory reset. These are the second pair of raycons I owned, the previous being the E55s, and these were a major downgrade. Don't waste your time or energy on a product with such poor QC. They did provide an immediate refund however I didn't want a refund I wanted earbuds that worked. Don't waste your time or money find a better product that won't quit on you.
