I should've known better than to purchase another TONOR branded microphone. I had another unit from the same brand last year that stopped working after 1 year. I decided to give them another shot with this microphone but i have to say I'm very disappointed in what they offer.1. The range of this microphone is relatively poor, and if you don't have it directly in front of your mouth, you will sound very distant.2. The overall sound range (left, Right, middle) is also very poor where again, you have to basically be directly in the middle of the microphone in order for your voice to get picked up.3. Volume control is very poor ont his microphone and you really can't modify anything.4. The overall quality of the microphone feels very very poor, and is made of just plastic with very cheap accessories.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this product to other shoppers, I'd spend a bit more for a higher quality mic elsewhere.
