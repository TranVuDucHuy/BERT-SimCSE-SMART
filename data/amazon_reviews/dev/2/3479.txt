I simply did not work, tried on two different computer, two different VGA cables. In Window 10 settings it showed the model number, but monitor would not work. I happened to have a HDMI to DVI cable adapter I purchased a long time ago and tried that and it worked. I honestly was impressed by the quickness of shipping etc, but was really disappointed that it didn't work.
