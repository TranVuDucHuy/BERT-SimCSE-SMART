The material is nice, but not ridged enough for large gauge extension cords. It’s very frustrating trying to stuff heavy duty cords into a very wimpy and very soft cord cover.For the $75 bucks, I’m dissatisfied. If this is for a smaller application, I’d also be dissatisfied. The cover is so so so soft, that it’s impossible to make a clean and straight cable run, which is the entire point of these types of products.
