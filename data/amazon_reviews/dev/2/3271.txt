Updated: Dropped some stars because within less than 3 months, the side arms already lost all power and the phone just lightly sits there not being secured by anything, hoping that the car ride doesn't encounter a bump. It shouldn't be a distraction, but it is. You have to glance to the side, far away from the road, and down, because you can't have it very high and the higher it goes the shakier it gets; the angle is already losing strength and the thing just swivels around loosely, making my phone face the window and reflect the sunlight.How hard is it to imitate what most suction mounts do and install a button in the front center that the phone presses when placed in the holder, and the side arms automatically spring to clasp the sides of the phone? And to have the release buttons on the sides so it's more intuitive, instead of reaching all the way around the back of the phone? Which is useless because it's already loose anyway.---Original review:I had a suction thing for my dashboard that kept falling off and leaving sticky residue in the heat of the sun. The vent clip-on ones I did not trust, and the dashboard clip-ons were not built for my dashboard. This was pretty much the last resort and only remaining option - sacrificing one of my cup holders.That said, it's still much better than putting a phone in the cup holder. Closer to your face and easier to see. You can change the angle and direction in any way you want. The disadvantages are numerous - too high and you can't see your console; too low and your hand bumps into it when switching gears; still too much to the side that you can't look at it while looking at the road; and most of all, it shakes with the car. No matter how sturdy it claims to be, by nature it's gonna shake because it's not suspended by a spring or stuck close to its body - it's got a gooseneck, so the higher you raise that neck the more it's gonna wobble with the car's movement. It's distracting.But still better than having a phone stuck on the cup holder and risking an accident every time you look down at your GPS.
