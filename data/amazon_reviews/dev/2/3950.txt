The sound quality is amazing! However it comes with TWO HUGE draw backs! Every time I plug it in, it disconnects me from my internet? Hmmm, very disappointing, as part of the reason I got this was to talk to people online: which is part of my job.HUGE BUG! If you try and turn your computer on with this plugged it, it just won't let your computer load! I was worried by computer was going down.The mic is borderline unusable, unless you're using it offline and make sure to unplug it.
