I have a temporary iPhone x, my iPhone 12 broke because of an unofficial charger so I bought these to use till I buy a new phone. I usually put my phone in the charger when I sleep and when I wake up it's not done charging and stopped. if I leave it in my bag it unplugs from the phone and takes a very long time to charge fully. doesn't hold in the charging port and it's very annoying. please, just buy a charger from the apple store. it's more expensive but a lot better than having to buy a whole new phone.
