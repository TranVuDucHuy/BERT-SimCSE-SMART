EDIT 1/6/2023: After normal use the cord has worn to the point that barely moving it pauses whatever I am playing (basically from a loose connection). Very annoying. I would be more gentle with the cord if you want it to last longer than two months.Ever since I first got a phone that did not have an audio jack, I should have bought this and the cheap pair of great sounding ergo fit earphones instead of buying a pair of Jabra earbuds that sound good but have a major flaw. These rechargeable wireless earbuds are the only devices that you can't use while they charge. What kind of sense does that make? They die after using them a few hours and then you have to wait for them to charge and repeat the cycle. And usb-c earphones are great until you need to charge your phone. And let's be honest, you're probably in bed while using your earphones so you want to charge your phone at the same time you're watching YouTube or listening to music.I don't care if mobile phone manufacturers remove the headphone jack if they would just include this accessory. Everyone will just buy it anyway. It's sad that we have to buy a device just to be able to use earphones with our phones.
