Just too plain expensive. There are third-party products that work just as well that are a fraction of the price. I paid $13 for four standard size black cartridges and two each of the colors right here on Amazon. I know inkjet makers tried to tie people to having to use name-brand replacements to keep their money flowing in, but their prices are insane. This isn't limited to Epson of course, HP and all the others try to do it, too. I'll be using the third-party replacements from now on and Epson will not get another dime from me for ink. If they priced their ink reasonably, I might consider buying it to support them. But when the price is ten times what I paid for a third party equivalent and it works just as well, why would I ever buy the name-brand item again? I know the ink might be a little better quality. But if I was printing critical photos or documents, I'd buy a much better printer to start with and expect to pay more for consumables.
