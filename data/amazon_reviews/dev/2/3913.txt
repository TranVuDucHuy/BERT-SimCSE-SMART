We chose this stand because of the high ratings. Once put together, it seemed wobbly, so we had two other people check to be sure it was put together correctly (one was an engineer!). A week after setting up our 65" TV (size and weight were both rated for this stand), the stand buckled and broke at one of the joints when my husband was moving the swivel part. The TV toppled over, but thank goodness his shoulder took the brunt of the fall so the TV didn't land on the tile floor. Be very careful purchasing this for a larger TV!*UPDATE after contacting Perlesmith* They immediately responded to my email to Customer Service and issued me a full credit. They realized they had an issue and they told me that had already improved their welding technique. It was a fast and easy process to work directly with Perlesmith - they get a thumbs up from me!
