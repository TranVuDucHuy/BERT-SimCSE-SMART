I got these for my daughter, since she wanted some headphones but prefers a wrap around the ear style. She was very happy with these, told me the sound was good, easy to use, comfortable, etc. We haven't had these for a year yet and they are now not working properly. They randomly shut down, disconnect from the device, and sometimes will start working again after being paired again, sometimes not. No rhyme or reason to it it seems. She has asked me to replace them, but I feel I need to look elsewhere if they won't even last a year.
