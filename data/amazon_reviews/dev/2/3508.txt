Bad luck!!!! I had ordered this a while ago, anticipating the need to replace the existing. As I opened the package, and attempted to load it in my printer, the printer refused it. Did not recognize it! It's taken me FOUR attempts, including replacing the color cartridges, which weren't yet quite empty, to get it to accept this cartridge. Of course, even though the expiration date on the package is November 2018, the "cut-off" date to return the item was May 13, so now I will have to live with an item that may or may not perform.Probably won't do this again on Amazon; will likely purchase locally, so that I can return and replace quickly.
