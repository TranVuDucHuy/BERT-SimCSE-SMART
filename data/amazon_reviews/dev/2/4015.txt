I'm a youtuber. I use microphones for every piece of content I put out, and have for years. And THIS is NOT a good quality microphone. At all. Compared to semi-cheap, but actually good microphones, this is a 2 out of 10. If you're a professional, AT ANY LEVEL, do not buy this microphone. If I can be frank: it sucks. Noise and voice quality is terrible.
