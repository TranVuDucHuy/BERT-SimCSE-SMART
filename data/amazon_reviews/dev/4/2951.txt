After purchasing Noise cancelling headphones (Shure AONIC 50, I have a review up of those as well)I realized that there were certain situations where headphones would not be ideal.I primarily use these outdoors, and running errands. I also have used them for sleep as well to varying degrees of success. It's a blessing to be able to pull these out of their container and put these on if I'm needing sound deadened from outside while eating, reading, or even walking through a grocery store or sitting in a waiting room where the medical providers seem to believe that a television blaring home improvement shows is "soothing" to the folks sitting there.Sound wise, they kick ass for what they are, if you're an audiophile it's not perfect, nor can they be. They're Bluetooth, and they're earbuds so don't expect them to sound like a pair of HD600's or AKG's, or your favorite set of headphones. Also, if you play garbage, such as low bandwidth streaming, or audio sources, you will know it as they are very unforgiving, and can be a bit disorienting. I was getting a warbling between the two earbuds and thought it was a problem with the earbuds, but I tried on a set of wired headphones and got the same effect which meant it was the source material and not earbuds.The biggest knocks I have on them are both frustrating, as they could and should be corrected.First the earbuds are rubber and work well enough, however if you are walking or moving briskly, you will get the feeling of them falling out, and in some instances I have had them fall out. This is easily rectified getting 3rd party ear tips that grip just a little better. This actually does help with the noise cancelling as well in some instances as well. If you're going to charge folks the amount of money that these cost. $20 for replacement eartips off the bat is annoying.Also, and this one can be a deal breaker for some folks. The charging of these earbuds can be frustrating. I had to use the trial and error method to finally determine that you can have it charge ONE bud and not both. So every time I put them in to be recharged i have to put one in. let it sit there for 30 seconds, if the glowing orange/yellow LED stays pulsing, it means its charging. Then I have to remove it, and try the other... and perform the same test. Sometimes all it really takes is wiggling them in the socket to make sure the connection registers. It's frustrating as you shouldn't have to waste 90 seconds to make sure your earbuds are charging. I had multiple nights where I put them in and they stated the battery was low even though it looked like they had charged. Since I've gone with the method above, I have not had this issue.Noise cancelling is very good, there are certain frequencies that seem to get through no matter what I try. My spouse uses a humidifier and if it is running at medium or high, I still hear it even with them in with my own white noise to block it out, it isn't severe, but it is there.Honestly, they sound and perform well enough, that even with those pretty big knocks above, I am keeping them as I've found solutions to the issues. Some folks will potentially go for the Apple and Sony alternatives but I've found that neither of those pass the sound tests for me personally.Pros:- Incredible sound from earbuds.- Great Noise Cancelling- Smaller than their prior version which was just too block-y to be of use for me.Cons:- Need to purchase replacement tips to get full enjoyment, and comfort from them- Charging can be incredibly frustrating and should be rectified by Senheiser sooner than later.
