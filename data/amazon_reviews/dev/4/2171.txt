These are decent buds overall, the ambient sound option works very good, it allows you to listen to music or watch something while still not being completely isolated. Noise canceling is not as great but you can tell there's a difference. Mic quality is good most of the time, sometimes some people complain of the mic breaking up or sounding muffled, but most of the time it's good. Bass quality is not as deep as I like but it's acceptable, it is deeper depending on the song but sound quality is pretty balanced and good overall.
