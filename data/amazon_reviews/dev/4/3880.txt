I received my new Star Adventure 2i Pro yesterday. Watched many YouTube videos on Setup and usage as well as read the user's manual in order to get familiar with setup and operation.I did a simple setup today in my living room. No weight used. I placed 4 new AA Batteries then removed them to use a USB battery pack.However, both had the exact same results when the Mode was switched to the ⭐. Using a metal rod touching the exterior enclosure and listening like one would use a stethoscope, the ⭐ mode runs ONLY for 30-31 seconds then stops completely. The other Modes run fine. The other Modes show slow-gradual movement over the course of an hourAny thoughts?____________________________________Next day update: After discussing this with the online community, it seems to be a bug with the Connecting the camera vis SNAP and the number of shots in the cellphone App in the Astrophotography section. Apparently, the App overwrites the Default settings in the Star Adventure 2i. You have to do a factory reset on the Star Adventure and NOT [✓] the number of photos to be taken, but leave it as infinite.I'll just use a Camera intervalometer instead.If there's a Bug Fix, detailed instructions on how to update the unit's firmware, and have them also GROUPED to the specific model, on the manufacturer's website.
