Great little headset. Sound and mic quality is excellent.The major issues are fit. It doesn't sit well into the ear so ambient noises can be heard, so you will need to increase the volume. It's is not easy to swap the ear tips. I broke two of them while figuring out which will work best for me. It also is terrible for those wearing glasses while at your desk or laptop. You are better off with an on-ear headset.
