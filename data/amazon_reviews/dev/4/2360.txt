First off, this is a great mount, and I would definitely buy it again. The joints are a little stiff at first, but they loosen up (in a good way) after some use. My only beef with this was the mounting hardware included. I pre-drilled exactly as I was supposed to, but two of the bolts snapped under the torque required to get them in. I could even drill them out, so I moved the location up about 6” and remounted. This thing is STURDY! When the mount was up, but the TV had not yet been attached to it, I walked in to find my 5 1/2 year old swinging on it like an Olympic gymnast. The thing didn’t budge. Spend 5 bucks at your local hardware store to upgrade the lag bolts and you’ll love it.
