First of all I am happy with my purchase. Having looked at the reviews I had quality concerns but I suspect a lot of the problems come down to a lack of care. The zip on the reflector is sewn onto a piece of webbing which is attached to the reflective surface. I typically push the edge of the reflector's outer ring inwards as I zip it to avoid undue pressure; simply trying to zip it shut forcefully will have the same effect but stress the seams considerably which could fail.Folding the reflector is essentially folding it in two then folding the two sides into the middle resulting in 3 coincident loops. Unfolding is simply a matter of pulling it out the carrying case: it pops right open.Next on to function. As a preface: at least one review used the white and black surfaces as background. This is almost certainly not their intended function and unless you can keep the light off the black and overexpose the white they will never look smooth.The device used without cover is a diffuser. It can be used analogous to a light panel with the same limitations: lots of spill to the rear. The material is also not hugely diffusive either so you need to leave quite some distance between the flash and diffuser to get any significant light spread which further increases the spill.The silver surface (matched with black) provides the most specular reflection though it is not very smooth meaning the light is softened slightly/spills more. It still yields fairly coherent light and also loses less light than the diffuse surfaces. It's gold counterpart (matched with white) functions similarly but adding significant warmth to the reflected light.The white surface provides a diffuse reflection considerably softening the reflected light. This obviously loses more light than th silver but provides for easy fill for daylight or flash photography. The black counterpart is intended for negative fill (reducing ambient contribution on part of the subject). This works as expected too.In use it's worth being conscious of their size. 43" might not sound much but they are not the easiest things to use ad hoc (balanced on a chair/propped against a wall etc). You will be better served either buying a stand/support, having your subject hold it or having an assistant help.As has been said elsewhere, the gold reflector and negative fill are probably used least often so matching white/silver and gold/black may have been a better design choice (I suspect their decision was an aesthetic one). Other than that and concerns about longevity of the zips this works nicely. I'd certainly consider buying another.
