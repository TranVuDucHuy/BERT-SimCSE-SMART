J-Lab has made a good name for themselves and become one of the more popular sub-$100 range of wireless headphones. While the company was on my radar, these were my first pair of J-Lab headphones, and the results were somewhat mixed. In the end, this is more of a 3.5 star review, and I'll explain why.First of all, there are quite a few things I like about these headphones. The fit is comfortable. For me, the tips that came attached worked well, and I've also appreciated the memory foam tips, which contour nicely to my ears. Those memory foam tips are a bit tricky to attach, but once on, they're great. Also, the sound quality is good for mid-range wireless earbuds. It doesn't rival some other brands in a similar price range (such as Soul), but it's superior to others I've used, such as the OnePlus Buds. The sound is generally pretty neutral, without any overwhelming bass or shrill highs. Music sounds clear and good. The battery life is also stellar. I use these for exercise, so I don't need 15 hours between charging, but it's nice to know I could travel all day or wear them from morning to evening without ever recharging if I needed to. It's also nice that the case holds a lot of extra charge. The wireless charging case is a nice benefit as well.There are several downsides as well. The main one is that the first pair I received was unreliable. One earbud, after around two weeks of use, began to refuse to connect to the case, so it wouldn't power off or charge. At first, it would connect sporadically, and then it refused altogether. The replacement pair has so far fared better. I also think that the usb cable that's a part of the case is kind of a gimmick and doesn't really add too much value. It's very short, and with such a bulky case, it's hard to position it well to charge. I'd prefer a usb-c input. The biggest downside, however, is that the noise cancellation is so bad that it's almost a joke. For a mid-range pair of earbuds costing around or less than $100, I didn't have high expectations, but I was still let down. The "noise cancellation" provides a barely audible difference in terms of surrounding noise. The memory foam tips do a good job with isolation anyway, but the ANC doesn't help essentially at all. If you want these because of that feature, look elsewhere. These are the wrong choice. I don't really like ANC for outdoors exercise anyway, so it's not a dealbreaker for me.One thing that's not necessarily a huge downside but is worth mentioning is that the case is very large. It's expected for earbuds with ear clips like these, and for me, it's worth it, especially for exercise/athletic uses.Overall, these aren't bad at all. The sound is good, they're comfortable, and the battery life is great. However, I had reliability issues with my first pair (which was replaced), and the ANC is seriously a joke. I'll also mention that if you want to be able to adjust the sound profile (which is a great feature), be sure to get the JLab ANC app, and not the other JLab app, which is basically just advertisements for more of their products and a total waste of time.TLDR: If you want good ANC, don't buy these. If you want nice sounding sport-focused earbuds with good battery life and a clip design, these might be the right ones.
