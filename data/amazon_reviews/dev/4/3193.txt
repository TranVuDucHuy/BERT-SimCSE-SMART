The lens is only kind of usable at 35mm zoom on a Canon full frame such as Canon 6D etc due to major Vignetting problems. Vignette is worst at 18mm but there's some Vignetting across entire range 18-35mm.The NIKON version of this same lens works much better on a Nikon D810 for example, much less vignetting and quite usable on the D810 compared to Canon full frame camera. This could be perhaps that Nikon has in-camera Vignette controls which try to minimize vignetting. I was tempted to rate it a 3 but thought maybe that's a bit too unfair since the lens likely works great on Canon APS-C cameras.Would have been great if it could work on Canon full frame as well as same lens works on Nikon D810.
