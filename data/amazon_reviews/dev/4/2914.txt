The Flip 6 sounds pretty good for the size of the speaker. FYI, this replaced an Anker SoundCore 2 which I still use elsewhere. The bottom end is a little mushy. I wish it had tighter bass, though it's hard to achieve with such a small speaker. The app is so-so, I wish it had more features and the ability to better fine tune the audio. Beyond basic. Lastly (for now), I absolutely hate where the power button is. I have the speaker sitting on my desk in front of me in front of my PC monitor. To turn it on I have to rotate the speaker forward putting a sharp bend in the charging cable. Why couldn't JBL just put it on top where it would be worlds more convenient?Anyway, only used for a short period. I'll update if something else comes up. So far to do like it but I'll withhold a recommendation for a while.
