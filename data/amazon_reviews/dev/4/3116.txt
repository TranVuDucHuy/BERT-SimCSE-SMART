Â I love about every feature on this camera! Even though it is larger than my first camera (Canon SL1), itâ€™s just as light! I love how the battery compartment and card reader are placed where I can change them out without having to remove my camera from the tripod! Thatâ€™s a big upgrade for me. The flip screen is definitely a bigggg plus! Also it comes with a lot of easy setting for beginners. I donâ€™t use them often but they do come in handy here and there. I prefer shooting in RAW and in Manual. But even if you are still learning the auto settings are pretty dope! I also love how I CAN transfer photos without removing my SD card! The only reason why this didnâ€™t get 5 stars is because it came with the wrong battery charger! I received a LC-E12 charger instead of an LC-E17. I have no idea how it got mixed up but after contacting Amazon, they purchased me a new one straight from Canon. It is November 6th and it says it wonâ€™t get here until the 18th of December, but I still appreciate the replacement. The photos above are only screenshots of the originals because the file size was too large and I didnâ€™t feel like going back in Lightroom. So it does not fully show off the true quality. I also attached a photo comparing it to my first camera. :) Hope if you buy it, you love it as much as me! My boyfriend actually surprised me with it because I wanted and SL3 but he did research and purchased this one instead. What he didnâ€™t know is I reallllly wanted this one too but I could not afford it at the time. So sweet of him. ðŸ’•
