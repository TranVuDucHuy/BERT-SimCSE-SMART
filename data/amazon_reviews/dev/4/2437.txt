Recently moved to a year round home, on a seasonal private lane. Picked Arlo as we wanted video, 3 to 4 cameras to cover about 2 acres of riverfront property. It was a great choice. Placed one camera about 40' away from the internet hub, it found it immediately and was a breeze to setup.Placed a second camera about 100' away, with a two car garage in-between it and that hub. Again set-up for Arlo showed strong signal and that camera was up and running in no time. Final camera was placed looking over the majority of the riverfront, easy install.Microphones are very sensitive, we turned off audio surveillance as the wildlife here and the wind was being recorded almost every 5 minutes. Motion monitoring works great and Arlo software recognized animals vs people vs vehicles very well. It will pick up vehicles halfway down our 600' driveway now, and we can see almost all of it thanks to multiple camera views.One wish... enable bulk erasing of recorded video, selectable by camera and by VIDEO length or time periods.If you are on the fence about inveting in an Arlo system, just do it. You will not regret it. We shared camera viewing with family and they watch our property more than we do, and let us know if cameras need charging or cleaning. Arlo made that feature very easy, well, sort of.
