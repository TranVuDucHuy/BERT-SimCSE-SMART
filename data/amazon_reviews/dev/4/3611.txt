I purchased these earbuds in March 2022 and by October 2022, the left earbud started to loose sound quality and produced a lot of static noise. Eventually, the earbud stopped working and would not charge or turn on. The earbuds were only used when I went running, so they were not heavily used on a daily basis. The fact that the left earbud failed so quickly with little use is disappointing.Up until the failure, I was happy with the earbuds, the sound quality, the fit, and the battery life were all good.I contacted Skullcandy for the warranty. I was instructed to send them to the company, at my expense. Once they received them, I was sent an email with a coupon code to use on their website towards the purchase of one of their products as a replacement.Due to the design, these are the only earbuds that fit my need. So I used the coupon code to purchase another pair. We'll see how the new ones hold up.
