These bands are MUCH more comfortable than the band that was included with the watch. Installation was very simple. Adjusting to fit my wrist was also very easy. The watch seems to stay in place well. The elastic nature of the bands makes it very easy to take the watch off and put it on. Itâ€™s fun to be able to switch between the different styles. There was a problem with delivering so I docked one star from my rating. Eventually that was sorted out.
