First of all i'd just like to say the picture quality and low light sensitivity are very good. The light is also very bright and the motion detection is pretty sensitive. The downside is it doesn't always send me alerts. it did in the beginning, but now i'm getting no motion alerts. also I had quite a bit of trouble with the initial setup. the camera WOULD NOT scan the QR code off my phone no matter what I did. I recommend setting up and updating the camera before you install it. I had to end up bringing it back inside and scanning the QR code off my computer screen. Stability is an issue too, the camera randomly goes offline but that could be due to my wifi, though I know another person who has the same floodlight/camera further away than I have mine and his works fine. The app can be a little wonky and unresponsive at times too. Not sure if it's connectivity issues or the app itself. Overall i'd say this is a good product but the bugs are annoying.I also don't like the subscription feature. this is not a good trend these days. I should not have to pay to have full functionality of the device when I already paid for it.
