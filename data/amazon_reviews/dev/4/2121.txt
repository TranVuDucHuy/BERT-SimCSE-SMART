They sound great, and have a good range for high and low notes. The only issue I have is that they tend to make a noise they really shouldn't on occasion. So the first pair I ordered had a sharp click sound when I put them in, or touched them, or just moved my head to fast. It was just the right ear bud and I still have no idea why but any way I got a replacement. The replacement has a slight issue with the left ear bud, yes I do have some strange luck. But atleast it is only when I an putting them in it makes a kind of plastic crinkly noise. This makes me think it is some thing to do with the speaker membrane. But at least I can live with that.Sound quality is great otherwise. They look really nice, and you get your choice of replacement pads for different ear sizes. This also has a fairly nice little spring loaded bag to hold them as well. And the noise isolation is nice, (they kind of work like ear plugs so you get a clear and clean sound quality, just do not actually use them as earplugs).If it did not have the problem with the noise on insertion it would be five stars, but two different pairs having problems is concerning.
