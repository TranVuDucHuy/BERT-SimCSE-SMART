This is my first set of premium ear buds by Sennheiser. I prefer their over ear headphones, but I needed something more suitable and subtle for video meetings that are required for my WFH setting.The pros that come to mind:-Noise cancelation. I currently have a personal server running 24/7 in my office, and it sounds like a small plane engine. These ear buds completely eliminate the shrill whirring. The clicks of a mouse and keyboard keys are still faintly audible from time to time, though.Sound quality - The sound stage on these is fantastic. There is a little sacrifice to the quality of sound with it being an in-ear device (think sounding a little compressed and less spatial in a way), but the mids are warm and the highs are crispy (sometimes in a way that feels like your skull is getting a nice scratch, so if that's too much you can adjust in their app). The bass is fairly restrained by default, but you can adjust that in the app as well. If you like music that is bass-heavy, these might not be the best fit for you.Controls - the controls are simple, and I love that they can be customized to my preference in the app. The auto-pause to music when taking out the right ear bud is a huge plus for me!Cons:The ear bud tips - the M3s come with various sized ear buds, but unfortunately (for me anyways) they get pretty uncomfortable after about 4 to 5 hours of wear. I wound up switching to aftermarket bud tips as I found myself fiddling with the buds in my ears a lot to the point where the inside of my ears started to chafe. The other issue is that the ear pieces will slowly come loose or fall out if you are talking or eating with them in. I primarily use the M3s for stationary/desk work, so this isn't the biggest dealbreaker, but I don't feel that they would be ideal for use with working out or any activity where you're moving around (or talking) a lot.Bugs - The M3s were a little bit of a pain to initially get connected to the app, but once they were set up I have had no issues there. The app immediately prompted firmware updates once connected. The only problem I seem to have is that if I take a phone call and hang up my left ear bud will stop working, or the noise cancelation will stop doing its thing temporarily. I have to return both of them to their case and reconnect them to my Bluetooth for both the left ear bud and noise cancelation to work again. Hopefully this is fixed in a future update.Overall, I've been very happy with the M3s, and they get pretty heavy use from me. I've been consistently wowed by the quality of sound these bad boys put out! Perhaps one day Sennheiser will come out with some comfort ear tips, but in the meantime I continue to be pleased with my purchase.
