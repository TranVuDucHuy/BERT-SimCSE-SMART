So I had the first gen of Jaybird earbuds a few years back and figured I would give these a try. Honestly these are probably my favorite buds I have tried in a long time! I've had galaxy buds, beats fit pros, airpod pros, etc. Here is why I think these are one of the best buds on the market rn-First off, the fit is amazing! They do not fall out no matter what, but I did modify my tips by cutting off the end to install a custom tip I use on all my buds. As the stock ear tips are one piece, connecting the ear wing and tip. The stock has great fitment, so that had nothing to do with why I removed them, just a preference thing. After that, as the title suggests- the stock sound should be more than good enough for most people. Comes with great bass, but still clear where it matters. The ability to EQ these in the app is what really makes these shine! I already have 6 different custom EQ presets I made, for different listening. So if you are willing to play with the EQ, I definitely would. As far as I know, the battery hasn't ever felt like it wasn't enough. I would wear these to the gym, leave and listen some more after a shower, and then a couple hours more. All that without charging then back up, so ya battery seems more than fine. The only thing that is a bit weird on these is the noise cancellation. They have a great seal, so even without it they pretty much have it built in, but they offer it in the app as well. I honestly don't hear a difference with it turned on and off, so I just leave it off. All in all great buds
