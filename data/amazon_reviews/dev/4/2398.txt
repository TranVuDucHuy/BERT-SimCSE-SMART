overall really great roll, i love the colors and how pretty it looks with green and yellow hue! but i had to give it a 4 star because my third roll kept on showing Error on my camera (when i put other roll in, it loaded perfectly fine) and i had to toss the unused rolll. but overall i recommend fuji film rolls !!! -- worked really great with flash for indoor pics.
