I love the camera and options on the app for the price. For what you get compared to the cost this has to be one of the better buys out there. Set up was easy. I would have given Wyze 5 stars, but the flood light itself would not show up on the app. I had to contact Customer Service three times, and it felt almost like getting the run around. They also required a picture of the tag on the light (even though it is installed already 11 feet in the air), a screen shot of the device info from the app, and a copy of the proof of purchase (this one I completely understand). Any other product would just ask for proof of purchase and not make you jump through the flaming hoop of death. I just wanted a flood light that showed up on the app. Everything else about the camera is GREAT.
