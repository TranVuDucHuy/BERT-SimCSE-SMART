For a sub-$100 field monitor, this is the best. Supports 23.98fps (when some monitors only support 29.97/60hz), great image quality, bright screen, and long use life when using an extended NP-F970 battery... But I have to knock it one star for not including a Power Supply, even though it supports a 12V source. Granted they let you know in the item description, I still have to knock it because they're cheap enough for the manufacturer to producer/procure... So just include it!
