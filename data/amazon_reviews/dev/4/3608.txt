Actually perform well as wireless earbuds. Larger than r*ycons and others, but actually perform well and have an earloop to keep them in place. Control button is on edge, instead of the first place you touch when you try to put them in. Fit well, good sound quality, each piece has an 8+ hour battery life, if using alternately - each piece fully charged before the other needs replacing, easy bluetooth pairing when opening the charging cradle, can use several 8 hour days before needing to charge cradle, definitely worth the money.
