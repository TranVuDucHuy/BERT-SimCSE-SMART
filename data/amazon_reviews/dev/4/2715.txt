These headphones arrived neatly packaged and in a timely manner. I was excited to find them in such a gorgeous color. The magnetic charging case is so conveniently sized! Their design is great for anyone that can't use typical earbuds because they feel too loose, etc. They were not only quick to charge, but to pair with my Android A12. They remain as efficient to this day, approximately one month later. I can rely on these headphones remaining in place while still sounding great. They also reduce outside noise to a reasonable level. My only discomfort stems from wearing them over an hour straight; it's at this time my ears will feel sore. However, that is more likely due to my ear shape and extensive use. I recommend this product!
