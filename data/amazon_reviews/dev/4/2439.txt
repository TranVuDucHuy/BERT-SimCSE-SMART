I had bought an Arlo Essential before and I ended up returning it because it said the wifi signal was 'weak" or "poor". I decided to give it another try with the Pro4 with the Black Friday deals. This time I moved my wifi point to the garage to get a better signal. It still said the bandwidth was "poor" but I didn't give up. I have had no interruptions, and the picture is clear. I don't know why it said "poor" if this is the case. It could make a person think they shouldn't be installing it if the signal is poor. But I've been using it for a week, get notifications regularly and a crystal clear picture. Still trying to see if I can minimize the notifications as I live in a condo on the main entry road and lots of motion/cars/people. I got it so I can see where delivery trucks go when I get notification of a delivery but nothing showed up. I can follow where the truck went to see where it was delivered by mistake. Also, I can watch for people coming to visit before they get to the door and make the dogs go crazy.
