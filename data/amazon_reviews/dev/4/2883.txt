There is nothing mechanically wrong with this GE extension cord strip. The 10ft model provides 600 joules of protection is better than nothing, but 1000 rating is optimal. 15amp is good enough for lights or small things, but not a hair dryer or appliances. 20amp is a preferred rating. The flat plug is ideal for behind furniture and tight spaces, not many strips provide this feature. However, we can't get past the safety covers. I suppose if you have toddlers or rarely use the strip, it is a strong plus, but we move things around often and the finagling of the safety covers are annoying.We are leaning behind a desk or couch, trying to get a plug to line up, twisting and turning, it simply makes it harder to use. Another qualm is the interior brass receptacle terminals are shallow, therefore short tongs like what is found on a lamp might not remain firmly connected if bumped. We can't rate this purchase low because of the safety cover provision where it is a matter of preference, but we returned it as not feasible for our use.As a note when this review was left, when selecting the 8ft option, the description incorrectly reads 1300 joules which is wrong, it is 800 joules.
