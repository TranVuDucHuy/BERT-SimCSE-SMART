The camera is great. It has great features, such as motion and noise detection, night vision, a siren, and a quite powerful built-in flood light...The motion and sound detection feature, combined with the options on the app to configure these features are quite poor though.You can set the sensitivity level on the app. It seems like setting it to 1 (minimum) or 99 (maximum) doesn't make a difference. Camera reaction is pretty much the same, regardless of the level set. And it is quite sensitive for busy/urban areas.For motion detection, one extra level of inaccuracy: you can set activity zones. This, combined with the camera modes, will tell the camera and the app if they have to send notifications on your phone if it detects any movements in the activity zone. But it will also detect movements outside of the activity zone. And it will keep sending you notifications for stuff you don't want to monitor. I want to detect movements on my front door, I don't care if there's a car passing on the street.These features need a lot of improvement. They might work great for the suburban lifestyle/architecture, but for city landscapes, this smart camera is not quite smart.
