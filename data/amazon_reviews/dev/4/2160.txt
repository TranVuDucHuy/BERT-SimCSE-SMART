I really wanted to like this microphone. I am using a GoPro 8 to film my E bike rides. The first test that I did with This Mic seemed OK but had more than usual amount of popping and cracking. On my second test it became so bad that nothing could be heard over this. My GoPro cannot even respond to voice command. I contacted customer service as per suggested to find out what could be done. Spoke with a very nice young lady who said she was in contact with her management team and would be able to call me back within five minutes. It seems pretty clear that it was a loose wire in either the mic or the cable. I also ask her if the application was OK for this Mike, and if it was not I was willing to purchase a different one that would be more appropriate. She stated no no thatâ€™s fine and she would call me right back. That was over a week ago and I have not heard boo sense. I think this could be a good product, but if you have anything go wrong with it their customer service is 100% unprofessional and unwilling to serve. As a business owner I understand how important customer service is and would absolutely recommend not using this business.UPDATE After I posted this review I did hear back from movo. A representative told me that the young lady I spoke to work by her self, And made a mistake by not contacting me me back. While I do not Buy into most excuses, I have to give a lot of credit that they reached out to me. He promptly sent me a replacement. The new mic works as it should have and actually has a very good sound. I updated to four stars.
