Honestly this camera is a bang for your buck other than paying to have it saved to your cloud every 30 days (if you don’t have an SD card) but now a days you have to pay for everything anyway… other than that the camera itself was easy to set up (make sure you select plug in camera upon initial setup I selected baby monitor and it wasn’t setting up lol) but I love that it alerts me whenever those motion, follows motion, has an intercom like a ring camera, night vision works good. The app is easy to navigate. Great camera for the price!! Highly recommend if you don’t want to spend but dollars on a camera for indoor purposes. If I decide to purchase a second one for my room it will be definitely be this one!
