I took a chance on this system after some serious research into this and the other options out there. Overall, I REALLY like having these cameras on my house. It provides a great solution to find out "what is happening" when I'm not around. I've got them covering the majority of my outside space, and a few inside to monitor the movements of my children in the evenings.Again, overall, these cameras a really nice. They have a "Fluent" mode, which is a faster, low-res, low-bitrate option that loads fairly quickly over wifi and cellular networks for live viewing. They also have a "High" mode that is higher resolution, and is really clear (but takes a few extra seconds to load, and requires higher bitrates - which is not great for Cell networks).I also have the solar panels, which are really handy. For the most part, the camera doesn't struggle to power - except this past month where it's been really overcast and rainy. That's not the fault of the Solar panel, in my opinion. Sometimes, you just don't get sun and that's the risk. The battery does drain a lot more when you increase the PIR Motion sensor, so there is a balance between Motion sensitivity and battery charging on Solar Panels. The highest motion setting seems to drain the battery faster than it is able to charge, and this sets the camera in a no-power situation, where you can't change the settings because there isn't enough power to get it on to load the settings, to change them, to lower them, to get it to stop draining the battery (first world probs), and round and round it goes.The one thing I am critical of is the Motion Sensor. From what I can tell, PIR Motion sensor is looking for heat changes on the frame, and when it senses a significant change, it starts recording. The problem is, for outdoor cameras, in the summer, on "MED" setting (because of the battery problem mentioned), it doesn't see movement. In particular delivery guys walking up the pathway/driveway or cars pulling into the driveway (which is the primary purpose for these cameras in the positions they are in). I regularly look between recorded clips to see no cars in the driveway --> then suddenly, to my wife's car in the drive unloaded without anyone in sight. I've looked to try and fix this, but unless I set it to HIGH mode, which drains the battery too fast, it doesn't pick up the car pulling to the drive. I would much rather have a motion sensor where you can set a ZONE for any and all movement (like the old Unifi Protect system), where it sees a level of pixel changes in the Zone, and records until the motion stops for 30 seconds. This seems to be a better way to do outdoor recording. As it is right now, the PIR method catches a lot of plant movements (wind), and not a lot of people/car movements. For an outdoor application, the motion sensor, in my opinion, is non-functional. It is not even a good reactive system, as it doesn't record what happened and regularly missed major events (arrivals and departures). Also when you turn off PIR, it doesn't record anything. This is a bit odd. You would think it would record all the time - but it doesn't seem to allow recording if the PIR is deactivated.Overall, I still like the system. It's cool to have eyes on my house when I am at work, and it works with Google Chrome for streaming and Amazon Echo Show devices! Really handy for checking on the kids upstairs while I am in the basement. 4/5 starts --> just fix the camera motion options for recording and I'll be happy.
