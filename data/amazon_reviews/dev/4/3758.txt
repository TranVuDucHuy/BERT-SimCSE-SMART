I updated my Camera's from an older model of Zomodo to Kasa. I love all the features Kasa has vs my older Camera's, such as the two way audio and the SD card capability. I gave it a 4 stars due to you can only view 1 camera at a time, MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT for me. I must say the picture quality is superb, I have all 4 cameras inside on my window seal. I have the night vision set to off and my areas are well lit. The set up was extremely easy.If Kasa reads this, please update the app to group the camera's to view all camera's simultaneously.
