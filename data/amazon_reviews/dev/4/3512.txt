First off the good: the battery life on these are insane. I never even think about charging them. They're also extremely lightweight, which makes listening for hours a breeze. ANC is also A+, I haven't heard any better.My only real gripe is with the transparency mode; it kinda just feels like you have a pillow over your head. With all the technology in these headphones I can't believe it's not any better. Still, amazing headphones and worth the premium price IMO.
