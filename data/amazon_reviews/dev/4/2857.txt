Perfect for wireless PC conferencing. The only wireless PC headset I've found that can actually mute it's MIC from a built-in button. In other words, no juggling with a keyboard/mouse, AND YOU CAN MUTE/UN-MUTE YOURSELF WHILE AWAY FROM YOU PC! Included bluetooth USB dongle provides color-codes and flashing patterns for headset status. Simple but huge feature that VISUALLY tells you if you can talk, and if other should hear you. No more "can you guys hear me" just to make sure you're not double muted. Again "Perfect for wireless PC conferencing." These feature are common-place for mobile-phones, yet super-rare for wireless PC headsets.Only problem thus far (I've had it for 6 months), is the battery only provide 3-4 hours of usage. Short for today's 8-hour remote-work day. It does not charge very fast. In all it is a rare and helpful device!
