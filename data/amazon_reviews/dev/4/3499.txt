These work really well for what I need. I have a USB drive connected to one and a wireless mouse connected to the other. The only issue I have noticed is slight lag in mouse activity when using these. So I can't recommend these if you are going to use them in a high speed game with a wireless mouse. But for any business or artistic (Photoshop) endeavor they are perfect.
