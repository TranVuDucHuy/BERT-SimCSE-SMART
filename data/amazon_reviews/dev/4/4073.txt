UPDATE: Excellent customer service. I was contacted after my review and they were sad that I was unhappy with the product. They offered to give me a refund or send a replacement product. For this alone I will give it another star. With that said, you could give this product a chance of you're looking for a phone holder. Maybe it was just my poor judgment of leaving it suctioned to windshield when the temperatures were fluctuating. Up to you though. The customer service alone would merit giving it a chance. :)ORIGINAL:I was tired of fumbling with my phone in the car hence the obvious decision to purchase this product. Great. My problem is solved! Eh, no. Not really...I originally put the little disk on my dash for the suction cup to stick to but even after leaving it on for the recommended 3 days, it peeled/tore off simply from the weight of the phone holding arm. My phone wasn't even in it yet. So I was like, welp, that sucks. Guess I'll just stick the suction cup directly to the windshield. So that seemed to work OK for a few days. It may have been my own poor judgement, but as soon as the temperature dropped, it fell off from condensation and got a bunch of dirt on it from the floor boards. So now the suction cup is practically useless.Overall I am very underwhelmed with this product. Will be looking for a better alternative. I would recommend you do the same.
