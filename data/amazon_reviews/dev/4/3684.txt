I love the comfort and feel of these! The only problem I have is that every time I use them (unless I just used them in the last half hour), I have to manually connect to the bluetooth on my phone...it won't do it automatically. Also, it doesn't automatically turn itself off, so if I fall asleep with them on, it keeps using the battery all night long and then some, if I don't remember to manually turn them off when I wake up.
