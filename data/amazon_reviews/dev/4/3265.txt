This is a great Step in the right direction for Canon. The Eos R has recently been succeeded by the R6 and the r5 but this camera is still worth a look. It's built rather sturdy has a great grip and the image quality is stunning, about what you get with the 5D Mark 4. The mfn bar is just okay I don't use it too much. I only wish it had in body stabilization, which is the reason I gave it a four star, but the digital stabilization for video works fairly well. My favorite thing about the camera is it's customization, you can turn any button into any setting you want and that's pretty awesome. I upgraded from a Canon 80d to this Eos R camera and it's been a great experience so far. Another great thing is that I am able to use all of my EF and my EFS lenses with the adapter which works flawlessly. I definitely recommend but it will be hard for people to not want to upgrade to the R6 for a few hundred more dollars. But please note that the ESR does have a 30 megapixel sensor versus the R6 having a 20 megapixel sensor. Again I definitely recommend.
