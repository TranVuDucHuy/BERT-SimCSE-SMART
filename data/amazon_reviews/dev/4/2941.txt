Ordered these, which are a slightly nicer version of a pair a friend has used at the gym for a year now. I went the step up hoping to avoid the “crunchy” bass sound that his sometimes have. These definitely improve on the sound quality, but there is still a VERY small amount of distortion. Small enough that he and other friends don’t notice it, but I do when I’m listening for it. Doesn’t sound like it’s in a box like some other low price speaker/earbud options do. If you’re looking for perfect sound, these aren’t your pick, but if you want a good enough quality for a great price, absolutely pick these up.Noise cancellation is pretty good, battery life (in the month I’ve had them) is impeccable. Easy to pair out of the box, and very fast swapping between earbuds. You can use either bud independently from the either, which is a feature some other low price buds don’t offer.
