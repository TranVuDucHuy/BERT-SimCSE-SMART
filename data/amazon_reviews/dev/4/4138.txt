I bought an iPhone case that came with a screen protector. While the case remained solid, the screen protector eventually cracked. It didn't hurt my phone, but it looked unattractive, so I got this two-pack of JETech Screen Protectors. I must say, they are fragile, even though they do keep the screen clean and safe from breakage. I replaced the original with one of these new ones, and it has already cracked. I'll have to put the second one on. If that one cracks, I'll be looking for something more durable. The cracked protector makes the face of the phone look broken, but perhaps that's a good thing if you don't want someone to take your phone.
