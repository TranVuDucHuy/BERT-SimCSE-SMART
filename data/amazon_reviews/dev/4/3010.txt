The only reason I didn't give this a total 5 star rating is that all the rubber ear buds are cheap and flisy. Really hard to get em on the little sound tube...other than that the sound is clear and crisp, volume is great and it is 4 way adjustable. Takes a while to maneuver it to fit best but it operates very well all around...
