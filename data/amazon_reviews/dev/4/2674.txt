I was pretty impressed with the optical quality and eye relief. Not so much the Phone adapter. I might give it another try with some rubber bands but the suction cup idea was a bit of a fail. Also, would've been nice if it could be rotated on the mount so the eye-piece was at something other that on top. Just not convenient for setting up on a bench.
