I got a new smart TV (samsung) with the only audio out being an optical out so my old headphones don't work unless I got a special converter. I decided to try the built in Bluetooth and purchase theSENNHEISER HD 450BT. They were terrible. Bad fit, bad sound, sent right back and purchased these RF headphones with optical digital audio input.Fit and sound are great. My objection is with the controls on the headset. I had to place a tiny pad on the down volume button to more easily find volume buttons. The bass and surround sound buttons are still a mystery frankly. Another quirk is the on-off button which needs to be held for 2 seconds to turn on. No mute button is another complaint. I'll get over these interface quirks and hope to use these for years to come.
