Considered the Reolink 4K camera (the cheapest) ,the Ring HD 1080p spotlight camera (most expensive), and this Arlo Pro 4 2K (mid price). Didn't like the Reolink review comments on the phone app and although the Reolink camera may be the better (5K), it does require an additional Ethernet connected device or a monthly subscription for best performance. The Ring has less resolution (HD). The next generation Ring has 2K video, but is $150 more than the Arlo, so I got the Arlo. I'm only using this camera at night between sundown and sunrise. Love the Arlo app. Turned the spotlight off to make it less obvious that there is a security camera at my front door. It's activated by motion of pets, people, and vehicles in the customized detection zone at times you want it to be active. Uses about 3% of battery per night with 15 or so videos each about 15 seconds long. Takes 4 hours to charge the battery 50%. Phone gets a notification delayed about 15 seconds after a detection event. Can snap a photo of a frame of the video, and zoom in on it on the phone. Arlo sells a separate base station with micro SD storage, but, without the monthly subscription, many camera features do not function. This is absurd. Took off 1 Star because the product definition did not mention that many camera features will not function without paying a $2.99/month subscription after the trial period is over. Wish it had better camera resolution (like 4K), but new Arlo Ultra Pro with 4K is $150 more than the Pro 4 plus requires a $150 base station to use the new model plus a $14.99/mo subscription! Too much money for me, at this point. Better than expected performance for a $160 security camera. For the money, $2.99/mo for one camera, this is a good buy in my opinion. Arlo was once owned by Netgear until 2016, fyi.
