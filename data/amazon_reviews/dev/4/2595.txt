I got this NexiGo PJ20 projector for our church to replace an older Epson that we have been using for a while.The unit arrived on time and was packaged well. One of the rubber feet on the bottom of the projector had come off and somehow attached itself to the front of the user manual, but that was easily resolved.It's a sleek unit, pleasing to the eye. The front has a large circular lens with a pop-off lens cap. The top front edge of the projector has embedded function buttons, designed to be operated from behind. The rear of the projector has two HDMI ports, two USB-A ports and one A/V port for inputs, and a 3.5mm output port. There's also a combination power switch and keystone adjustment knob. Included with the projector was a remote (requiring two AAA batteries), a power cable, an A/V cable, a user manual and a cleaning kit. Amazon did not mention a projector case with the NexiGo, but I was still disappointed that one was not included. I have purchased several projectors in the past and they all came with carrying cases. However, Amazon has many offered by other vendors that I can select from.Now to its performance. It is bright, even at its default setting. Brighter than the Epson. The overall picture clarity is good as well. Setting it up -- I connected an HDMI cable from my laptop to the HDMI1 input on the projector, because that would give me an apples-to-apples comparison to how we currently use the Epson. I did have to fiddle with the Windows 11 system settings at first, because although the projector displayed the PC image, Windows could not "detect" the NexiGo as a second monitor. I changed the desktop display settings from "duplicate" to "extended" to run my third-party presentation software (which I also had to reconfigure), enabling the NexiGo to function as a separate display. Still, Windows could not detect the NexiGo as a display. Perhaps the projector isn't recognizable as a display in Windows. Not a show-stopper for me.The included remote was a helpful plus. I used it straight out of the box to turn on the projector and to configure settings. I give it mixed reviews. It's simple enough to navigate through the on-screen menus, but at times I needed to be careful how I touch the buttons (example, short press vs. long press for the menu). Using the focusing function was a bit tricky. When I want to focus, a generic focus screen appears in place of the image I am actually trying to focus, which I don't like. To me that's extra overhead--but it does work.Finally, I wanted to see how the NexiGo connects wirelessly. I didn't get very far connecting to a network. It appears that this projector can connect only to discoverable networks that display on-screen. I wanted to connect to a hidden network, but found no provision for that, which was surprising. There was an "IP" icon that brings up a screen listing different protocols, but on that screen I was limited to selecting an icon showing a broken chain--which did absolutely nothing! (By the way, our wireless router was in an adjacent room, fully operational with no solid wall between it and the projector. My laptop and cellphone were not far from the projector, and they both had solid wi-fi connectivity, so I could conclude that a weak signal from the network was not the issue.)So I was happy to see that the NexiGo supports Window Cast. Of all the screen casting options this projector provides, the Window Cast seems to be the only one not requiring a standard network connection to function. So I selected this option from the on-screen menu, then set my laptop to search for the projector. Bingo! With one click I was connected. With my PC about ten feet from the projector, the picture quality was decreased slightly but not terribly. As I streamed some online videos, I noticed a one-half- to one-second delay between the video and the audio, which I found noticeable perhaps because I was looking for it. Sadly, before long, an intermittent connection issue occurred in which the transmission would become choppy. Attempting to resolve this, I moved the computer around to various distances from the projector, eventually placing it directly next to it. Didn't resolve the issue. I had kept the computer plugged in to AC all that time to maintain its power and keep the casting level constant.I did not do a firmware upgrade before testing the NexiGo. The manual recommended against it, saying that all new models are shipped with the most current firmware and there was no need to upgrade it out of the box. Perhaps I should have upgraded anyway? Would it have made a difference?All in all, I like the projector and plan to use it in place of the Epson in the future, but mainly for wired HDMI connectivity. There are a lot of features I did not test which may come in handy down the line. For its low price, this NexiGo is a pretty decent projector.
