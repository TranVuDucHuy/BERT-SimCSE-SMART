Had them for one year, and working just fine. Can't complain based on the price. I use them often and will be upgrading due to a few annoyances I just can't stand any more.1. Sound isn't the best, I have the volume maxed out all the at the gym and just doesn't seem loud enough. They are water proof though, which may have something to do with it. Prior better sounding buds have been ruined due to sweat and moisture build-up while working out.2. Feature issue. I'm not sure which button it is but you have like 3 or 4 on the right bud. Push one of them while you're adjusting your right ear and it calls a (random?) number in your contact history. Multiple times I accidentally dialed work clients! All from slightly adjusting that little headphone packed with buttons. Frantically try to pull out the phone and touch end call before it registers as a missed call for them or they answer. Multiple times had them call back and had to explain it was by accident. Felt like an idiot.3. The ear wrap holder is somewhat flimsy so the buds still tend to come out of the ear when sweating and moving around. Although the flimsy-ness makes them more comfortable than the hard plastic ones. They don't fall and dangle, just latch on and swing from the ear. For me running especially does this. Then you have to adjust while running, and end up calling your boss at 5am on a Sunday!
