This is a smart way to bring power to an existing light fixture. I intended to install this into an outdoor lantern-style light fixture outside of my home. The installation is straightforward and literally takes seconds. The product screwed easily into the existing light fixture and the light bulb into the adapter. Unfortunately, due to the additional length added from the adapter, the light fixture couldn’t be reassembled without finding a very short/squat lightbulb. Since I didn’t want to look for specialty bulbs or buy a larger light fixture, I returned this product.
