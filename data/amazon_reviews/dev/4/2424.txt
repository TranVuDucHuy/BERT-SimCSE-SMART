We put this up in my daughters room and she thought it was so cool! For the price it works great. The picture is clear, volume is good. My only complaint was that I didnâ€™t realize I needed to purchase an additional adaptor to play from my phone when I bought the projector so if that could be stated somewhere it may help another customer avoid the frustration.
