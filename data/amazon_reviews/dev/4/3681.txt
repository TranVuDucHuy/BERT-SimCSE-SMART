This mask has pads so that my false lashes didn't get smashed. It successfully drowns out the neighbors, my husband's snoring, the dogs, all of it. Completely blacks out all light. It's wonderful. The speakers are great, not too large so I can side-sleep. I listen to binaural beats and am able to get them loud or quiet enough to block out ambient noise.One little down-side: the dye comes off the mask onto your face. Yep, wake up refreshed, looking like a raccoon. It scrubs off easily enough, but that lasted for about a month, even after disassembling and washing the mask a few times.Oh and the velcro is designed for securing around the widest part of the head, but I fasten the mask around at the base of my head so I don't need nearly as much play.
