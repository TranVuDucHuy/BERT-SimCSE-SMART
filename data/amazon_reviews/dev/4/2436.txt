I want to like this product. The price is good. Setup and installation is simple.However the software used to view the cameras and events is tedious.In the past I've had a custom camera setup with a DVR. That was expensive and required maintenance.I then switched to the Google Nest ecosystem. While I like the hardware and software, I find the cost of cameras too high especially when a lense can occasionally pop off the camera.Arlo seemed to have a great price point with higher specs but the software is frustrating.ConsConnection to the camera is slower even when on the same network. Night time lighting is not as good as other cameras. Previews are stills and not animated. You have to click a clip to open a page and then click it again to play it. On the PC, every time you view a clip and go back, the time resets to the current time and you have to find the clips again. I am unable to download recorded videos from the PC, but the mobile versions do work.
