The function button on my DJI Pocket 2 does not work as described in the manual. When I pressed the button multiple times to re-center of to change the camera's direction (forward facing or rearward facing), it would only change between photo mode and video mode. It would only work in video mode if I kept pressing it more than the number of times (2 or 3) as described in the manual. It seems to work as described only when it is in photo mode. After I re-centered the camera or changed its direction, then I can change from photo mode to video mode.The battery also ran down quite quickly. It could be because I was experimenting with all the different settings. I bought a Smatree power stick so this should not be a problem.I have not tried the external microphone. The wifi works fine. I can control the DJI Pocket 2 using a smartphone remotely over wifi without having to use the smartphone connector. This allows me to see the camera view on the smartphone even when the DJI Pocket 2 is far away at the end of a fully extended extension rod.
