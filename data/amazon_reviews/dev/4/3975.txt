I tried two other cameras in the past with two different dual band routers.The good:This is the first camera that actually functioned through connection of the 2.4G band of the router. That is why I provide the 4-star overall rating.The running video images look clear.The bad:The time it took to load the video camera image after first installed sometimes took 5-6 minutes. At the time of the rating, the times have improved to a few seconds.The camera image snaps are sometimes blurry.
