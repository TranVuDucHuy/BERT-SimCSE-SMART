This is an initial review, since I just got this NVR.Background :I was looking for a decent camera system, to replace (2) separate 720p systems. I had Zmodo and Jooan Systems. The Zmodo system worked ok, but the iOS and Android app was somewhat iffy. Also, Zmodo uses a proprietary "4" wire / Cat 5 cabling system (they call it "simplified" POE), that I regret running. Otherwise it worked good and the cameras lasted, including the IR bulbs.The Jooan system (using the XMEye App- which was buggy) worked well, used Cat5e and was ONVIF. But the IR bulbs burned out in about a year, so they were useless at night. Each unit I used their proprietary NVR. The Zmodo NVR was hooked up to the lan, and the Jooan was hooked up to the Lan via a TP-Link Ethernet of Powerline adapter.My problem-Replace all cameras and run them on a computer based NVR (Zoneminder). This required (2) POE switches. (1) for the local set-up and (1) for the Ethernet over Powerline system.Reolink cameras are infact ONVIF compliant, and Zoneminder did see and was able to record (running on a test computer). But, there is no PTZ profile and more importantly, I need a good computer with at least an Intel i7-8400 and min 8G ram to run this power hungry "heater".With Zoneminder and a new POE switch (BV-Tech), I was able to power and get data from the new Reolink camera using the crummy Zmodo cables, YEAH!The solution-After reading all of the negative reviews on the Reolink NVR, from klunky interface, to loud squeaky fan, etc etc etc, I figured let's try it out.Initially, I tried using the Zmodo cables with the Reolink camera. It was a no go. So, I had no chose but to use the POE switch (from the Zoneminder experiment).That was OK, since re-wiring was a dreaded task.Now, my Reolink NVR sits on the LAN, with the 4 cameras on the LAN using the POE Switch (and 4 cameras via the powerline and a seperate POE switch), and it worked just fine. The phone apps are very good, and thank the gods, they have a MAC desktop client. My other camera systems REQUIRED windows and REQUIRED Internet Explorer and the hateful ActiveX.The client software integrates well with NVR. The NVR itself is somewhat "unrefined", according to today's slick interfaces. But, once you set it up, I have no need to look at it.**** One important and confusing note, the NVR has a warning stating to NOT connect the VGA or HDMI cable until after you power the unit. What happens if there is a power outage??? **** I find this very odd. I pulled the sticker off and placed it on the FRONT, so I don't forget. **** but what happens with a power outage and power comes back.....REOLINK?My configuration works well for me, since I can still directly connect to each camera. If you used the NVR's POE, the NVR has a DHCP server, creates a Class "B" network, for the cameras. You cannot directly connect to each camera, you must use the NVR, to control/config the cameras.Overall the DVR works very well. It uses by far less electricity than a dedicated computer. It easily recorded full stream, 8 cameras,out of 16. and the PTZ works well. ( but the PTZ speed of "32" is way to fast over the phone app or client software this is adjustable on the client software, but not on the app_____ hmmm....I digress).Sadly, the NVR it is proprietary, too. But Reolink is in the camera business, not the NVR business, so they have a vested interested in keeping you "locked" with their DVR. Reolink has a nice, and honest "paper" on their site about using a Reolink NVR, or using the Reolink Client software to record or using a 3rd party NVR.The NVR connects over the internet using a Reolink "UID". It is probably similar to a dynamic DNS service, where you don't need to open ports on your router/firewall, which is nice.Again, this NVR works well , and so far I'm happy with it.
