I'll be right up front - Akaso reimbursed me for my purchase as payment for testing and reviewing this camera. I've made every effort to make this an objective, honest review. I have been an amateur photographer for 40 years and worked professionally for a number of years as a human factors researcher and designer with Bell Telephone Laboratories, and have been giving Akaso feedback on the user interface of this camera. I own three of these cameras,, starting with the 5000 model, then the 7000 model, and now this Brave 4 model. This is by far the best model of the three. though the user interface needs work. Thus the four stars instead of five.Akaso has been responsive to my evaluations, and I have decided to present an abbreviated overview of the camera here plus photographs with technical details on settings and ways to make corrections to the images if you wish.I generally correct the lighting (levels) because I always shoot with the exposure value (EV) turned down a stop or two. However, often the images are so good, you may not want to correct them at all. I'll start with the good stuff because the bottom line is that this is a fantastic little camera.I"ve concentrated on still photos because all three of the Akaso cameras produce outstanding videos. If you would like to read a good review of the video function, here's a link: https://prodrenalin.com/review-akasa-brave-4-action-camera/ . The stills show a remarkable improvement with the Brave 4 and its Sony chip. Below are a number of examples I shot with permission in gallery store in central PA. Most are inside, some outside. I'll upload more later. I've found that to get the best images, choose the settings as follows: gyroscope on, WDR off, angle as you like, there is less distortion with the smaller angles, special effects off because special effects usually add a computerized aspect to the images, though I have not tested it in this camera yet, image size maximum if you want all the pixels and information that the camera produces, quality fine, sharpness off because you don't need it, white balance auto because auto work great, color I have not tested, ISO should be set as low as you can get away with because 400 gets grainy - the set I'm uploading today has an ISO between 100 and 200, EV (exposure value) can be set at a negative 1/3 or one stop lower to get the best color - I use minus 1/3 (but be aware that reducing the EV means the levels probably have to be corrected later on), thrun antishake on and you are ready to roll.Take your photos from at least 4+ feet away. While the camera has an outstanding depth of field, it does not do well with closeups. It also will occasionally zoom to 5x - a new feature - but it is not optical zoom, it's a digital zoom so the zoomed image is only slightly better than cropping a non-zoomed image. Try to keep the camera parallel to the ground to reduce distortion. You can also avoid distorting the image by making sure that major horizontal objects in the scene are also horizontal and straight in your display. If they are curved, you are tilting the camera. Don't do that. Hold the camera as still as you can before and after taking the photo until the display information is again printed on the display. That keeps you from moving the camera while the lens is still open. Look for color because this little camera produces absolutely fantastic, realistic colors. Keep your fingers away from the lens because the fish-eye wide angle will photograph anything that's close to it - the wide angle is 170 degrees wide.The images below were taken inside and out using the setting above. I've tried to pair them with the original image from the camera, rotated if necessary. The corrected ones were genrrally corrected in Photoshop Elements or Fastone. Elements has a great distortiion filter, and adjusting levels and white balance is a cinch in either program. I only needed to correct white balance for two images and the correction is very small but obvious. These photos are difficult for any camera because the lighting was a combination of natural light, tungsten, and fluorescent - a hard combo for even the best cameras. This camera shined in this situation. The photos are reduced to about 500 kb. In general, the original images were 5-6 MB, at 72 dpi. According to the charts, that's enough for at least a 24x36 print.I'll try to upload different ones with explanations of how the camera was set occasionally, but this set is a pretty good example of what the camera can do. Now I keep it in my car or pocket all the time.Here are the main issues I have with this camera. They don't outweigh the good features, so don't let them stop you from purchasing the Brave 4 at this great price. However, this camera would be even better if these items were corrected: (a) the battery door is easily lost and not hinged. I use a piece of scotch tape where the hinge should be to keep from loosing it. (b) the control process is clumsy and hopefully can be improved with a firmware update. I won't go into detail; you will see what I mean as you click through the order of items (c) there is no really useful user manual. A good one could be done online very easily. (d) the wi-fi is hard to understand and get to work...at least on my devices. Same with the wrist band control, and instructions for both are lacking.Again, none of these things is a deal-breaker at this price. If this camera cost $300 or more, they would be much more of a problem.Make a comment if you have questions, and hopefully it will get sent to me. J
