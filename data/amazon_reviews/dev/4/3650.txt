this surge protector/power strip provides a nice point of connection for up to 6 devices.their are nice features.. angle flat plug for wall. long cord. one outlet separated from rest to provide room for a power supply connection.however, overall, there is not much heft to the product. on/off switch feels kind of cheapy. overall construction does not approach a similar device from years past.if it lasts, these shortcomings will be overcome by the feature-set of the product.
