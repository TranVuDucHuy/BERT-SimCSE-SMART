Gifted to my 6yo for Christmas. He thinks it’s cool, but other stuff is more exciting from all the presents he got tbh; I checked out the picture quality on this little microscope and there’s a tiny learning curve for how to best use it but I can tell it’s well made and he will grow into using this especially come spring & summertime. Just hope the battery doesn’t give out before then!🤞🏼
