Summary: For the price, this unit does everything I need and works well. I would buy it again.My first impression was "This is the most generic packaging I have ever seen." It is absolutely no-frills. I'm not even certain who the manufacturer is. (See pictures.) But the package did include all the necessary components and they were packed well, with a mostly environmentally materials.My intended uses:1. Document scanning for genealogy hobby.2. Inexpensive lighting platform for taking stable shadow-less cellphone pix of items to sell online.3. Video conferencing without unflattering shadowing.For the first use, it works pretty well. I have a document scanning app on my phone. With this, I was able to scan a 30 page document pretty easily by hand. A little tedious, but saves me the expense and clutter of yet another piece of computer hardware (a flatbed scanner).For the second use, I tested it with my foamboard backdrop and a china saucer. I was able to dial in the light intensity and color temperature fairly well. There were, however, a few challenges. I will note them at the bottom of the review.For the third use, I set the light up for my work area and tested it with my video camera. (See picture). I use a camera that sits on top of my monitor. The light stands just high enough to clear my particular monitor, but anything taller would require something to put the light on top of. Again, I was able to dial in the intensity & color to my liking.As for caveats & drawbacks ...• The base, while heavy, is not large enough. When the light ring is rotated to face downwards, the light tends to tip forward. This is manageable by placing a heavy object on the base.• The little extender in the middle of the light is not like what is shown in the pictures here (as of Nov 2021). It is longer and flexible. I like the flexibility, but not really a fan of the longer length because it puts the clamp offset from the middle of the light.• The clamp, while fairly strong, isn't perfect. I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 phone. When the ring light is horizontal, bumping the clamp can sometimes cause the phone to drop out. Also, because of the placement of my phone's power button, the phone itself can't be centered in the clamp. (More of a phone design issue, than this clamp, but worth noting.)On positive notes, the main arm can rotate 360° so you can secure the base and point the light another direction. The various screw knobs tighten well, so things do stay in place. The camera clamp is on a ball joint, and the extender arm is completely flexible, so there is a great deal of pointing / aiming freedom.Overall, it was a reasonable price, functions well and I would choose this one again.
