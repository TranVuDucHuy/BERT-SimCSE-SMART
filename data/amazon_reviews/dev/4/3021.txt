Good sound. Well made. It must be plugged into an outlet and is quite heavy to me. It should be labeled as a desk top model, not a portable. While it is easy to be connected with my iPads and iPhone, I have trouble to connect it with my Samsung phone. My Samsung phone will not recognize its existence nearby even the speaker is on connecting mode.
