They seem to do what they’re intended for but they do crack a little easier than I’d like. What I guess you get for the price though. I did notice the last time I ordered these I had my wife order them because she has the prime account but the fit seemed a little off. Maybe they weren’t the same brand so I’m not 100% certain but anyways good for the price.
