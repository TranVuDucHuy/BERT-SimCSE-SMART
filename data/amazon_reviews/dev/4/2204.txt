I bought these for the gym the sound quality and noise canceling is great. My only complaint is when I'm at the gym the connection gets really and cuts out due to interference with other Bluetooth devices. It sucks because I bought these specifically for the gym and that's where they lack in performance. I wish the software could be updated to solve the connection issues in Bluetooth heavy environments like a gym
