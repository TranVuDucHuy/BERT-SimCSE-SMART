I have the s22 ultra and while the gimbal does its job, because of the phone being a bit larger, then other phones, it's not centered on the holder well, so it sometimes becomes top heavy and the stabilizer fails, and if youbtry to center it as much as you can the back of the gimbal keeps getting in the way of the camera, I had this problem mostly with portrait style landscape was a bit better but overall it's not too bad once you work your way around it.
