This prints out good photos at a decent speed. All in all I love it. It's small making it easy to travel with, easy to print your pictures and comes with a decent size case. It dosen't come with much photo paper so you definitely want to order extra when you order the printer. The case is roomy and holds the printer, cables, and a whole box of photo paper. I would recommend buying this.
