I got initially few sub 100$ drones and 170s GPS drone. Ended up returning all of it. Also, around the same time I got DJI mini SE, which I still have and works just great. Ended up returning all other drones, since none of those drones were able to stay stable. Then I read a review about this Tello drone and decided to give it a try. The 1st one i ordered started behaving erratically and falling down within few minutes, so I sent it back to exchange for another same Tello combo pack. The second Tello does the work, appear stable, even with light wind manages to keep its position. The software that comes with the drone controls the drone pretty well. However, there is a problem with camera colors, it shows green/gray picture, very low quality, basically unusable. Id return it because of the camera issue, however, I read in other reviews that its a common issue for past 1-2 years after Tello software update and Tello FPV 5.99$ software solves the camera problem. Indeed it worked pretty well with my drone, the camera takes pretty good pictures . I gave 4 stars for the camera and software issues, otherwise , its pretty good drone.
