I ordered this for my classes at school so I could both record videos on a tripod and set it up on a desk for Zoom. So far it’s working perfectly, it seems very steady for indoor use on carpet or wood. I don’t know if it would hold up as well on uneven ground outdoors.As far as quality goes: One of the legs is pretty loose when it’s folded in but it doesn’t appear to affect stability. Not a big fan of the bluetooth remote- it’s SO tiny and the battery cover is really loose, it tends to slip off in my hand. The connection however was super easy, hold the button on the remote and pair it on your phone. My biggest complaint is that the middle extension piece gets stuck, it requires a good amount of force and I’m worried I’ll break a part.Overall, if you’re using this with a phone indoors it works as well as expected. I have to take a star off for the quality, but I would still recommend this product.
