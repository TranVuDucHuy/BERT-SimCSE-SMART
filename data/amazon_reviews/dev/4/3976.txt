Another update: recently put a micro SD card in. I love that it allows me to play back the video without needing to purchase any type of subscription but I hate how hard it is to click to find the right spot or timestamp to view.Update: saw a comment about the being able to turn off blue light. You have to click the pencil icon to edit and turn off the status indicator under basic function settings.The setup is not difficult but it is kind of annoying to do if you move the camera around to different houses. Picture quality is pretty good for the price. The one thing I can't stand is the blue light underneath the camera to let you know it's connected properly. It lights up the whole room. I have to cover it up with tape or another object so it's not shining in my baby's face. Overall, good for the price but I would buy another camera if I knew how bright the light is prior to purchase.
