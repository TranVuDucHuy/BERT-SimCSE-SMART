I spend all day on MS Teams calls in an office so my headset is critical gear for me. I was using a Logitech H570e. That was a good solution, comfortable, one ear so I could connect and speak with coworkers in the room. The challenge for me was the long chord all over my desk and the inline controls drove me crazy. It would occasionally mute me or drop my call if the button got touched. Also, it would catch on my armrest and jerk the headset. So I did some research and found the Trucker Bluetooth headset. I'm really enjoying it. I ordered it with the charging base in my never-ending quest to keep my wire management under control on my desk. The sound is very good, It's liberating being able to step away from your desk for a moment and not have chords. I haven't tested how far I can go without being dropped but it's covered all of the moments I've needed to do so far. The headset also had a scratch-off competition that came with the headset. I won something and thought that was cute but when I reached back to collect it, the person who followed up was so gracious, friendly, and appreciative of my purchase. Not trying to upsell me, or anything like that. She also wanted to confirm that everything was good with my purchase. Such a refreshing interaction. If you looking for a reasonably priced wireless headset I'd definitely recommend this one. I haven't run out of battery yet and it took a little bit to get used to connecting when I pul it off the dock but now that's super easy as well.
