I didn't want to write this review until I had a lot of time with these earphones. After weeks of rigerous use and while working (delivering for Amazon), I have a solid opinion on this product.I wanted to be able to listen to music and talk on the phone while on the go or at work but isn't really possible with wired earphones. These Galaxy Buds 2 are a great option but definitely not perfect.The sound quality of the buds 2 are great but if you don't keep them clean, the sound quality goes down. The battery life of the buds and case are quite impressive. I use only 1 bud at a time which each lasts me about 4 hours while the case can last about 16 hours on a full charge. The ambient and noise canceling features are great too but the ambient sound feature can get too noisy if it's windy or a lot of stuff going on in the background. The phone quality is good but sometimes the person I'm on call with has trouble hearing me if I'm moving around or there's too much background sound (which is usually the case while I'm delivering) but still works okay so don't expect the best quality with phone calls. I also love the wireless charging feature.Overall this has been one of my best purchases of the year as I definitely have gotten my money's worth and enjoyment out of this product. If this'll be your first wireless earbuds, just give these a try!
