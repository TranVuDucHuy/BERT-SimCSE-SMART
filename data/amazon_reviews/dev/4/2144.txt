This headset has the capability to handle 2 devices at once, I use a computer and cell phone at the same time - it works well. Using the dongle caused problems with my compan'y's remote software. It would bounce from working to not working just because of some sort of power save function I believe. Finally, over bluetooth, I get this issue where the sound fades in and out. I don't know what this is. It happens from my cellphone and from my computer so I know it isn't either of them since I own several sets of earbuds and headphones that do work with my devices through bluetooth and do not have issues. It causes me problems when I am trying to concentrate on listening to others while they are attempting to show and tell with me. So anyhow, I was thinking of returning them since they are just at the 30 day window now, but I guess that will need to wait.
