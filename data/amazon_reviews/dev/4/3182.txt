This device is nice and compact for the ideal use for Travel. I will be traveling in the upcoming weeks and look forward to trying it out. In the meantime, I tested the different settings on my laptop camera (infrared light), cell phone (full-band), router (wi-fi) and they seem to work well.The only negative is that when I put the device on the Full-band setting it does not light up at the bottom like the wifi setting does, but it still works. Other than that, I look forward to using the product on my travels.
