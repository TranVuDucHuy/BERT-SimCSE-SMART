The battery lasts so long for me. I use them at work and the only issue is it feels like it's wanting to choke me if I put them around my neck. It's never bought me dinner, so I just put them back in my ears.Sound quality is great and it has really good noise blocking qualities. Overall, these are my main headphones now. I have 3 different types and these are by far my favorite.
