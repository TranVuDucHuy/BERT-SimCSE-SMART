Highly suggest this for anyone looking for an SD Card for their Steam Deck. Got it in the mail today and popped it right in. The Steam Deck itself only goes up to 100Mbs, the card I got being the 512gb averages at about 130Mb/s at both read and write so it's more than enough Pretty happy with my purchase.
