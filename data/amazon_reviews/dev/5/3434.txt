I don’t leave reviews at all so me leaving should tell you how impressed I am lol I bought this in 2019, although it feels way longer, but nonetheless I’ve always loved them. Even when I switched to an android for a bit, I still used them for everything. Well last week they went through the washer and dryer. I was devastated. I thought all my money went down the drain BUT they still work and I’m highly impressed. I called my mom to test out the microphone and she could hear me so it still works. I’ve charged the case no problem. The AirPods themselves still have amazing sound quality. I’m so impressed. Please buy these if you’re on the fence.
