I got these as a upgrade/addition to my existing Samsung Galaxy Buds+. The Buds Pro 2 are certainly a upgrade with the ANC and other features like voice detect to turn on the ambient noise when someone is talking to you. I haven't tested this in a area with a lot of people talking so can't say how well it would work then. That said audio quality is really the same as my existing Buds, which isn't bad. Samsung just makes good quality sounding ear buds. They are really a balanced audio output, but you see have the ability to adjust if you like more bass or what not. Not once have I hear of any distortion and they can be plenty loud as needed. The only thing I don't like is the case form factor. The Galaxy Buds+ have a case that is a rounded rectangle which is great as you can quickly open the case without looking. The Buds Pro 2 is a square so you can't just feel where to open the case. This is really only a problem when you try to access them in the dark. Annoying, but not the end of the world. As for in ear feel when wearing them I struggle to decide which I like best. Buds+ have a pressure fit in place feel so you know they are there and securely in place. The Buds 2 Pro feel very light and mould to your ear, but at times almost feel like they might fall out. They haven't yet, but it is just a different feel, hard to describe. I will say the Buds Pro 2 certainly charge up faster which is good when I'm working a full day with them on. A little 15-20min bump charge in the case and I easily have enough battery to last a full day of listening to music with room the spare. In summary I would still recommend them.
