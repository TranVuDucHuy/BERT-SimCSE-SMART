I loved that the instructions were clear and easy to execute. The high quality and reasonable price really put this bracket over the top. Also, the kit comes with nice touches like mounting template, Allen wrench, multiple screw sets to mount the brackets to different TV's, and a small level to get the bracket straight. Well done and let me know what else you are selling, because I'm sure it has to be great!
