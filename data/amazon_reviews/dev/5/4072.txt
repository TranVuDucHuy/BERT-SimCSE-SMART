This review is for the 13.5" 3K model that displays 3000x2000 pixels. I wanted a high-resolution display that could substitute for quality prints. The screen display is about 11"x8", so it approaches the 300 dots/pixels per inch needed for superb resolution. The colors are bright with excellent contrast. The display absolutely exceeded my expectation. The touchscreen is easy to use and pretty intuitive. There isn't really a "Picture" selection on the menu. Just touch the displayed photo at the center of the menu screen and that takes you to the correct menu.Setup was easy. The device appears to use the Android operating system. I plugged it in, connected it directly to my desktop computer with the supplied USB to micro-USB cord and the display was recognized by Windows as a new device. One simply transfers any MP4 or similar video to the "Movies" folder and photographs to the Pictures folder. Note that the device happily handles sub-folders, so you can take the "Yosemite" folder on your computer and copy it to a "Yosemite" folder on the SSA Frame. When displaying photos randomly, it uses all folders and the software does a good job of avoiding "repeats."Important note--you'll be better off deliberately preparing photos for display. I use Photoshop Elements and simply cropped each image for a 12"x8" crop at 250 pixels/inch (which yields the 3000x2000 expected by the frame). Save as a JPG. The frame can convert images for display, but be assured that a Real Computer running photo software will do this better than the frame.If SSA introduces a 17-19" 3K photo frame, I'll buy it! One suggestion--it would be nice if the device could display videos along with photographs when on "random".
