Got these on the black Friday sale so I could see what a higher priced pair could do. So far very worth it for the price. My ears must be shaped weird as I'm not able to wear the inner-ear kind and the left always tends to fit poorly vs the right. These are comfortable and tend to stay put 98% of the time as I'm walking around/riding my scooter. The sound quality is great, if I have them all the way up I can't hear anything else. If I had to list one con I'd say it's easy to lose the case as it's very small but that's a personal issue haha. I'll probably buy these again once they die. Love em!
