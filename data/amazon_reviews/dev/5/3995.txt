UPDATE <Needs clarification>: I had placed the original review at 4 stars, as it was not a material/craftsmanship problem, but rather a “my equilibrium” problem (actual medical problem exceeding “clumsy.” I’ve also accidentally been in drywall. No fault of the drywall 😬).PLEASE NOTE - I didn’t merely tip this guy over - I took it out with actual momentum and force. Involuntary, but *far* exceeding normal accidental circumstances, nonetheless. I have victimized objects that are much more substantial than a tripod. My original review was favorable (this thing is super cool) even before the seller was kind enough to contact me. I had never complained as the build/materials were not defective. I also made it clear to her in private messages that she shouldn’t have to replace, as their was nothing wrong with the product at all. “It’s not you, it’s me” 💁🏻‍♀️(What’s that word kids use for essentially chucking something?) It was extended to maximum height. I have a concrete patio. Add in me barreling at it, and you have a recipe for maximum damage potential. I was impressed with the product - it has a lot more going for it that any other stand/ tripod that I have seen. I assessed if favorably. It would be unreasonable to be dissatisfied with it when the product was in no way inferior.So, not their fault. Despite my clumsy self being the cause of the break and not a defective product, they offered to send me a new one. I really appreciate that. As stated in the original review, the adjustability, build and quality were impressive. They certainly weren’t obligated to send another, as it was my fault.(Previous) I managed to accidentally take this out during setup. Their is only one part that happens to be solid plastic and doesn’t have adjustment/flexibility - the very top, where the stick meets the housing. It is not their fault that I knocked it over. It is solidly built, I just took it out with clumsiness and hit just the right (wrong?) spot. Not a product defect. At any rate, it was easy to connect with the remote. Very nice looking. The adjustability was very good as far as angles that you can place the phone. The part that holds the phone was nice - you didn’t have to fight springs. It adjusts with a screw mechanism. I really hate the spring ones, so that was a definite high point. Very helpful in general, but especially for those of us with dexterity issues. There is a knob that adjusts that part. It articulated down very easily, and much farther than any other product that I have tried. The telescope adjustment was firm, but not something that you have to fight. It seems very sturdy and was stable on the tripods, when I had actually had it seated right instead of being excited to take a picture of my dog. The bag was nice, and the remote holder is a very useful addition for someone that loses everything. With it being small, giving the ability to leave it attached to the tripod was a well thought out design.
