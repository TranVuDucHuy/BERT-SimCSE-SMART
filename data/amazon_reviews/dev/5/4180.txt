The quality is excellent and the installation was a breeze. After reading a lot of the negative reviews I had my doubts, however, do this and you will be happy with the outcome. Read the instructions twice, I put together the plate that goes on the tv first to make sure the holes matched up before drilling into my wall, they matched, then I found the stud it would attach to with my stud finder, I then hammered in part way a finish nail on either side of the stud in order to find the exact middle of the stud. Then place the template on the wall with the holes dead center on the stud and level. I then drilled the holes AND screwed in the 3 screws almost all the way (minus the thickness of the mount) then removed them, put the mount up and reinserted the screws (Made it much easier to tighten) Hang the tv and insert the two screws on the bottom so the tv cannot be lifted off and your all set.
