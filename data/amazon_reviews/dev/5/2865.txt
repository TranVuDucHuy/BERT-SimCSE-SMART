These earbuds are not for the audiophiles or people looking for noise cancellation. I use them on break at work and around the house. I haven't had any issues with connection. Since I use them casually, I haven't had problems with battery life. I love the color and they feel light but secure. I have trouble finding earbuds that stay in my ears and these work great for me - even with activities like yoga. A personal complaint is since they utilize touch instead of buttons, it can be hard to put them in or adjust them without registering pause or skip or volume changes, but that indicates that the touch function works well. Love them!PS I don't think my picture properly portrays their color haha, I got the lavender and they are true to that word. My picture looks more blue. Trust me when I say mine appear as advertised!
