I purchased this mount for a 43" LED TV and it is working perfectly. Installation was easy and securing the TV to stay level was also done with little effort. The Range of motion is great for this size TV or anything smaller. I can almost get to a 90-degree angle to the wall it is mounted on. Also when fully collapsed the TV doesn't stick out from the wall excessively. One recommendation that I have is to use your own tools. While the included level and wrench will get the job done they are low quality as you'd expect to be included in the box with a mount like this. You'll need a drill and bit to drill pilot holes to properly secure the mount anyway so having your own level and wrenches as well will make the installation go even more smoothly.
