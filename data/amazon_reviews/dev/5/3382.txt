I got this for a 32" Samsung. It took all of 20 minutes to get it mounted to the TV and then to the wall. Directions are clear and easy to follow. The hardest part was getting the TV onto the wall mount, a second set of hands would have been helpful but I got it done. I really like the range of motion as this is mounted in my office it lets me move the screen so others can see it from around the room.
