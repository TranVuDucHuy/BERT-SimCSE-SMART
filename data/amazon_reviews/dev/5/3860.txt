I got these as a Christmas gift for my husband and he LOVES them. He works as a machine operator in a loud factory and these noise canceling headphones were what he said the best and most thoughtful gift because having earbuds in for 8 or more hours was beginning to hurt his ears and so were the machines so he's truly grateful and happy to have these incredible headphones.
