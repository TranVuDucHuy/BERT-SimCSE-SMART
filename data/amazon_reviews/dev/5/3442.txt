Touch screens are great but I have an android tablet I use in the garage to access the internet for information while working on projects. Greasy fingers and gloves don't work well with touch screens. I installed this adapter to be able to use a standard USB wireless mouse dongle. I wasn't sure if the tablet would know what to do with this arrangement but it works perfectly. The adapters came packaged in a great holder that can be used to store them when not in use . Buy two / They're small. Very pleased.
