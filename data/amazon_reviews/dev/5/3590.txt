Received in original, and pristine packaging - no scuffs, rips, etc. Loaded up in my Switch without any issues.For those less tech savvy, the storage capacity shown on the card is for UNFORMATTED capacity. When the card is formatted, it will ALWAYS be less than the advertised price. Some of this is because, as formatted, it will reserve portions for future 'repairs' to the data. In other words, if a portion of the card becomes corrupt or unusable, it will substitute part of that reserve for that data.This has been industry standard for at least the last 30+ years for any data storage device.
