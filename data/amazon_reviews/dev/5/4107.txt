I have an older version of this power strip. I spilled coffee on it, into the outlets, and it still works fine. But it might not be a good idea to use it on my new tech, so I got a new one. Still, I spilled coffee on it and it kept working. Plugged in my internet hardware and gaming computer. The rotating plug is nice. It's a good product.
