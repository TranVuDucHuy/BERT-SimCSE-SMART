I have a Lenovo T470 which has an SD card slot allowing the card to be fully inserted (doesn't stick out). I wanted to offload photos from my main SSD, so I fitted this as an expansion drive. It's slower than the main SSD, but fast enough for photo storage and easier and less expensive than upgrading the internal drive. Samsung flash devices are known for their reliability, that was the reason for my brand choice. So far it's working flawlessly. The T470 can accept SD cards to several TB, so 512GB is no problem.
