I got my son a rebuilt computer for Christmas along with a new graphics card. I was unaware that the monitor with the system I purchased only had DVI and displayport connections and only came with the displayport cord. The monitor absolutely has to be connected to the card to display an image. The graphics card has HDMI and DVI ports, so I needed a way to make them interface.Voila! This adapter performs perfectly. I have the DVI end plugged into the monitor and the HDMI end plugged into the graphics card. Works exactly as expected and my son is playing Kaiju Universe on Roblox with no visual lag as I type.
