 I would like to start by saying, I have used headphones ranging from dollar store to a 400$ pair of Klipsch, so I know a thing or two about quality headphones. VERY IMPORTANT: Earbuds will take about 80+ hours of use before they sound their best (burn in period). At first, they will sound very low and staticky at max volume, compared to after 80+ hours. For those first 80 hours, keep the volume set between 75-100% (whatever your general listening volume will be).I always let them play for 80 hours, while I am not using them, before I write a review. Overall listening experience can change THAT DRASTICALLY from the first time you put them in, to after that 80+ hour burn in period. They will sound louder and clearer after this point.Now, TL;DR+ For the price, they sound great!+ Small, lightweight and very comfortable!+ Charges fast (both buds and case)!+ Touch controls are very responsive!+ Noise cancellation is some of the best in its class!+ No annoyingly bright LED lights!+ Ability to use one earbud at a time!+ Excellent range, even through walls, in a house full of wireless!NOTE: Device dependent – Sometimes cuts out until placed in case, unpaired, then re-paired- Removing buds from case is a bit complicated- Case: charge port cover is a pain to remove, and does not get better with time- Case: remaining charge indicator is not very accurate- There is no way to check the charge level of the buds while using a computer- While adjusting earbuds, it is easy to hit the touch controlsTHE DETAILED REVIEWCLARITY: (the ability to provide strings, bass and vocals clearly without distortion). These are considerably better than that of the brands priced around 100$. They do not offer the crisp clarity of my 250$ Sennheiser studio headphones, but at this price I would not expect them to.BASS: Nowhere near as good as something like say, beats earbuds, but they are sufficient (on par with the clarity). Comparing them to the higher priced offerings, they are about equal, if not a bit better. But I have had cheaper wired headphones with better bass. If you’re looking for some ear booming earbuds, these may not be right for you.NOISE CANCELLATION: Even though the max volume on the T6 earbuds are not that loud, the seal they provide blocks out about 95% of your surroundings. I have to deal with blasting TV’s, kids and various other noises throughout the day. Through all of that - playing music, movies and podcasts - I can BARELY hear anything else (and that is when I am trying to listen for outside sounds).This may be a problem for some, who need to hear their surroundings. I suggest using a smaller bud size to help alleviate this, but keep in mind it will also affect overall audio quality. There are 4 sizes of buds; S, M, L, and XL. S fits my 6 year old, all the way up to XL for me (I have huge ear holes! LoL). So make sure to try them all! It is important to find the right size, again, because it affects the overall audio quality and noise cancellation.They are extremely light and VERY comfortable, and compared to others, are far less awkward feeling. So much so, you could sleep with these, as long as you are not on your side. Laying your head down on a pillow with these can causes a tin can effect (sounds like music coming for a tin can) at certain angles. Still, they are comfortable with some pressure put on them. The charging case is exceptionally small, smaller than most of its kind. It is also compatible with wireless charging docks! Charge time, when the buds are completely drained, is about 30 minutes, and the case is about 60 minutes to completely charge. I will say, the charging port cover for the case is a real pain to open!The touch controls are simple and responsive! Touch either the left or right earbud to pause music and video (does not work with VLC media player for some reason). Hold your finger on the PRIMARY earbud to turn volume down, the secondary to turn it up. Double tap the Primary earbud to go to previous track, and double tap the Secondary earbud to advance to the next track. Unfortunately for some (who accidentally pause tracks or video, when adjusting their earbuds), there is no way to turn off the touch controls. As a side note, there are no annoyingly bright LED’s in the earbuds that bug some (like me).Something I found curious is that many reviewers complain about difficulty in removing the earbuds from the charging case. I have found placing my pointer finger inside the back of the case to push in and pry the earbud up, and then pulling it out the rest of the way by pinching my pointer finger and thumb on the earbud and pulling out, works quite well. I have huge fingers, so I can only assume someone with smaller fingers will have less of a problem using this method. I will attach a video showing this.Another issue that a lot of people seem to be having is that they cannot use just one earbud, while the other is in the case, charging. I do not know if the newer ones being sent out are updated? But mine have no problem doing this. The first pairing to a device requires you to have both out, but after that you are good to go. So as of this writing, you DO NOT have to have both earbuds out of the case for them to work properly.Also, I don’t know if it is just my pair, but the life indicator on the case is off. I have charged my headphones 1.5 times and the battery level is down to one, even though I can fully charge them 2 more times at this point. So, if it seems like the case battery is draining faster than it should, test this out before you contact them for replacements.Now, there is a slightly annoying effect that seems to be dependent on the quality of the Bluetooth in the device you connect to. Sound will start skipping or go out for a second and come back. If this happens to you, simply unpair the earbuds from the device (first) and place the earbuds in the case for a moment. Remove them and re-pair, and you should be good.I have noticed that my laptops Bluetooth does this quite often, where as my desktop (with a better BT dongle) does not do this. It also never happens on my iPhone or kindle fire. So, like I’ve said, it varies depending on the device Bluetooth quality (it is not the earbuds themselves). The Bluetooth on the earbuds are quite nice. So nice in fact, that I have gone more than 30 meters (their rated distance) line of sight, and still had a good connection (at 60 meters). However, if you are experiencing this with all of your devices, try turning Bluetooth off on any devices near the earbuds that you are not using (they may be causing interference. Otherwise, you may have a defective unit.In closing, these are the best pair of completely wireless earbuds I have used to date (when taking quality, price and design into consideration). They are impressive, to say the least! I have done so much research and tried so many different brands, that I can say with confidence, that if you’re in the market for this type of earbud? Do not hesitate in buying them!
