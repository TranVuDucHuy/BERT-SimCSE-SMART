super adhesive... I just removed the film and was trying to find the correct position on the windshield - (mind it, I did not even press the lock button) - it got stuck in one place and I thought I would remove and stick diff place - nope, nada - it was hard to take it off windshield.. applied more force and I was seeing residue - so I left it in that position. - God knows what will happen when I have to take it off to use it in differenct carAnyway, it came quickly...as mentioned in many reviews, it is sturdy. I checked in my car - when you lock the cradle knob - it gets locked. you can increase the length by using the telescopic knob and a pivot knob can be helpful up and down.there is a magnetic spring button - there is 2 use of it1-Magentic cord - (there is a cable tag in the packet) - it is magnetic and it will help your charging wire to stick with the cord,2- also this button can be pushed (push and slide it down) to free your footI did not use a dashboard pad.release bar: the only issue I can see here is - if you have sensitive mobile or some glass/sophisticated cover - by locking your phone against it - it gets locked in a very hard way and it doesn't have cushion with it so phone could be damagedotherwise, it is a very good car mount and I guess my search ends here...There is a manual on the amazon item page (search by CTL+F) - you can find more info there...thanks-Sanjay Gupta
