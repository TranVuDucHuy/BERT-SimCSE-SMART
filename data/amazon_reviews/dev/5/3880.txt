What is good: Great quality. Good mount template. Ability to shift right or left depending on where the wall studs lie. Nice to adjust tilt as the level may be slightly off once the holes are drilled. Plus, when you shift left or right, the weight of the TV shifts and will not be level until you adjust it.What could be better: The instructions could be a little better. It doesn't state why you need to install the brackets on the TV first - to set the right height! The mount may not be in the middle depending on your TV.This costs a little more than other mounts, but it's one that can be trusted and adjusted. It's also more economical than other solutions costing much more. I can't imagine those are any better.
