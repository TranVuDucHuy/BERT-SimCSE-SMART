Packaging says made in Korea. I ran it through Samsung's Memory Card/UFD Authentication Utility and it comes back genuine (important because there are a lot of fake/counterfeit micro sd cards out there). Getting it set up for the Nintendo Switch and moving the Switch game data onto it from my old 128GB micro sd card was pretty easy (there are guides on YouTube on how to do this). The micro sd to sd converter that's included was helpful for doing this on my PC which only has an sd (not micro sd) slot. The Switch detected and formatted the card without and any issues. At 512GB it has more capacity than I'll probably ever need for my Switch games.
