When first installing this TV Mount a week ago, I was amazed and greatly pleased with how well-made the mount was, and how easy it was to install. The most pleasing part was the amazing assortment (an 18" long plastic-wrapped set) of various fasteners that anyone could imagine attaching the mount to a wall. Someone had mentioned in the reviews that it was too hard to position the mount. Well,- not true. Obviously, the person did not adjust the screws and nuts to obtain the right tightness. It is very easy to mount and adjust to one's liking. The instructions are very informative, and I would add that one should only use a lag screw into a STUD at the top hole, as they stated. I rarely rate many products five stars, but this TV mount rates 5 or more. A best buy!
