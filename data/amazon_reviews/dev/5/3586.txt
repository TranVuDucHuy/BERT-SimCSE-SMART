For the price and storage amount you get itâ€™s a good deal on my opinionI was debating to get the higher Gb storage 512gb I think it was but it was almost $55I instead decided to go with this one , I feel between the storage on the actual oled switch plus this 256 gb micro sd is more than enough to hold a significant amount of games will update review as I get more use out of it
