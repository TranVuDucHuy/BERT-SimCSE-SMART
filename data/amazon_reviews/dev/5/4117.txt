I don't usually do reviews but I've been using my Meeting Owl for about two months now so I wanted to give a review for a good product since I use it regularly. I do meetings with 2-3 people at my location and we use Zoom to connect with other meeting participants. I like that the participants on my end can sit face-to-face around a table instead of lining up on one side of the table. With the Owl in the center of the table, the remote people can see all of us around the table, giving the meetings more of a 'natural' kind of vibe. Set up and usability is pretty easy and straightforward, and I like that the unit uses a USB-C since most of my other devices are moving to these as a standard.Good stuff!
