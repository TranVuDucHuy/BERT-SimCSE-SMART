Bought a pair of these for our steam decks and they work great. We don't have the NVME version of the deck, just the MMC version, but we don't notice any performance difference between the internal or the SD card.I didn't run any benchmarks because that only tells part of the story. The real test is when you are using it for an everyday task like launching/playing games.There are a few games where I really notice it, such as Shadow of War, but that is a huge game and it really only impacts the initial loading time.Overall, i would definitely purchase again
