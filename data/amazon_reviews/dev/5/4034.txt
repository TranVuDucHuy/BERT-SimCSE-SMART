Fairly easy to install, took about 30 minutes to install correctly,but make sure find the wall studs and so make sure the bolts will drive into studs when installing this product. Just using the sheetrock will never hold our 55" TCL TV, Directions makes this pretty clear.I would tell you buy a stud finder if you do not have one, to find the studs before installing this wall tv mount.Recommend second person help with installing on wall and to help hang the tv and lock it in place.I would buy this again.
