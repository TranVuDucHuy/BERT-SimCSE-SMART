Bought this for my brother but he had a Samsung phone and it did not charge it at all. I then give it to my sister who had Apple for phone, headphone, and watch. The reason why I decided to go for a 3/5 for charging power is because compare to the actual wire it charge slower and since sometimes I also want to use this wireless charger for my phone too but I would have to get my phone out of its case since I also installed a phone stand.This thing is not fit for traveling 1/5 star because it needs to be plugged so unless you have a portable power.I also rate the easy to use 4/5 star because it definitely is less stressful to charge stuff. As you won't have to search and untangle wires instead just slide the stuff onto the wireless port. The reason for the knockdown of one star is just because when I had install the watch magnetic charger at the back it took me a while and kinda hard to seal/close the back cap. Everything else was good.Otherwise this produce is pretty good for its value.
