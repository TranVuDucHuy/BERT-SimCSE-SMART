This little mount was so easy to install in my vent, adjust to the right angle, and I love how easy it is to set my phone in the mount and squeeze the sides to hold in place. This fits my iPhone 12 Pro and would hold a larger phone easily! I also have a pop socket on the back of my phone and it still grabs the sides of my phone without a problem. It also held my friendâ€™s Samsung s21 plus comfortably, which is larger and heavier than mine. This mount is awesome for using the maps on my phone hands free without having to look down instead of using the tedious process of putting in an address on my car GPS. I love mine so much that I bought my husband one for his SUV, too!
