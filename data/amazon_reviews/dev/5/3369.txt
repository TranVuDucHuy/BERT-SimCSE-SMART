This is exactly what I needed. I am using it for a DJI mini 3 pro drone and it has more than enough storage for me. The included adapter makes it easy to use the card with devices that have a full-sized SD card slot. The build quality is great and I have had no issues with the card becoming corrupted or losing data. The price is also very reasonable for the capacity and performance of the card. I would stay clear from any off brand cards, pay the extra dollars to get this one!
