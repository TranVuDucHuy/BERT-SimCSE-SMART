Update - after using them for a couple more months I have to say I'm starting to get tired of the charging case. It takes me way too long to get the ear buds to actually connect to start charging. When you finally get them to start charging make sure you don't bump the case or else you'll be back to fiddling with them for another minute. Absolutely forget about trying to charge them when they're in your pocketThey have pretty good sound, good battery life, and stay in my ear pretty well. However, getting them to charge in their case is not as easy as putting them in their case and letting them charge. I have to make sure every time that both ear buds are perfectly aligned in the case. Also less than 2 months in and the microphone does not work. Overall they're okay but I was hoping for better
