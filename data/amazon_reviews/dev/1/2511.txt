I bought these for my boyfriend, and within less than 4 months they lose charge so fast that, even while switching between earbuds, they barely last 2 hours. The case doesn't stay charged either. while they fit good and sound fine, it isn't worth spending over 100 dollars for something that won't even last 4 months before becoming so bad with battery that they have to be replaced. I have also come to learn that this is a pretty common issue with racon earbuds and suggest that you try another brand because these are a cash grab and really suck.update: Raycon reached out to me and provided a full refund for when I bought these, however, while the customer service was good I still don't recommend you purchase these since the issues are so common and you aren't likely to get enough worth out of these for the price you pay unless something changes in the manufacturing.
