I emailed Gearnuts and was told I was outside of their warranty. This item has no on or off button and I swaped out the cables to see if it was the cables that did not work but it was really the cloudlifter I got from Gearnuts. I just want a working version. I rarely ever rate a company on amazon before but have purchased at least 3-4 packages a week from amazon and this is is the first time I feel like I'm not supported as a customer.
