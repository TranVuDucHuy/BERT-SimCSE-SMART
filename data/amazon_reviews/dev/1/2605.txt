It's very pretty as shown but doesn't work well at all. The volume all the way up is just a tiny bit higher than anyone's regular voice. It sounds a tiny bit louder with the echo all the way up but other than that it's all mainly for looks.The Bluetooth does work well. But again the music is not very loud at all coming through it.
