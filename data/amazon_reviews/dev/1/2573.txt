The original battery lasted about 2 or 3 months. Since then, everytime I replace the battery it lasts under a week before I get a notification telling me to change it. I've tried multiple different brands of CR 2032 batteries, and none of them seem to last longer than any others. Now I'm seeing that lots of other people have thus problem.Do not bother buying this product until they roll one out that utilizes battery life better or, better yet, is rechargeable. This is absolutely ridiculous. Smart Tag+ price is fairly reasonable but then it feels like you have to pay a monthly subscription (because of constantly buying new batteries) just to use it.
