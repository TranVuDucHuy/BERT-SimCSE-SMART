Nice looking microphone. Hoped my daughter would like it. Seems like it would be fun. You're supposed to be able to play music (that you sing along with) via an SD card (but the SD card can't be larger than 32 GB and only MP3 files). But that feature didn't work. The next option is to play music via a Bluetooth connection to a phone or tablet with a music streaming app. But of course the Bluetooth connection appeared to be broken - I was never able to see it with my Samsung phone or tablet, in spite of numerous attempts to find it while the microphone was no more than a few feet away. The speaker on the microphone worked. It's not all that loud, since it would ultimately be in the hands of a kid. But unfortunately, could never really test playing music through it while singing along with it, because of the SD card and Bluetooth connection problem.
