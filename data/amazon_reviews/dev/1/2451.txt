I really wanted to love these, but I bought them to help with the Tinnitus while going to sleep. If anything, this made it worse. Frustration can make Tinnitus go off the charts, for some people. I happen to be one of those people. And, after spending an hour or so trying to keep the mask on and to be able to hear anything, caused me no end of frustration.One of the positives is that it was easy to set up with my Android Phone and with the Tinnitus therapy I have on it. The manual is helpful for that, at least.No matter how much I tried, I could not fit the mask to my head well enough for me to hear anything through the speakers. I cannot understand how anyone can hear anything through them unless they hold the speakers right up to their ears. And with this band, it would not stay on my head. I tried to cinch it up, but it still kept slipping down. Also, with all the padding over the speakers, I had to hold the right one onto my ear. I couldn't hardly hear anything in my left, if anything at all.One thing I did like about the eye mask is that it is soft and did not hurt my face or ears. I would love to find a sleep mask that is as comfortable as this one. (I wish we still could comment where people helped each other, but I guess Amazon thought they knew better. Maybe someone could recommend a better alternative for me. )As far as cutting light out completely, I saw light coming through the bottom. I did not even try sleeping with it because, after spending two hours trying to adjust it enough to hear anything, I decided I'm going to send it back. I imagined what it would be like to sleep with it where my ear would be on my pillow and my arm over my left ear so I could hear something.I do not recommend this mask for you if you have a small head. Maybe for someone with a larger one, it might work. It sure didn't work for me. I think I might try this brand, Musicosy, head band next.UPDATE: I woke up with my eyes burning. I'm just going to use them for when I'm awake or give them to a friend. I haven't decided yet.UPDATE April 4, 2022 I woke up with my eye feeling like something was in it. Now my eyelid is swollen and there is still discomfort. I've tried it for a few nights and I just am not happy with it. So I am giving it to a friend rather than having to figure out how to send it back.
