This mask is comfortable; the sound has a deeper bass than my other sleep mask, but that's not really a problem; I listen to YouTube white noise videos to help me sleep. What IS a problem is the Bluetooth connectivity. It's HORRIBLE. After connecting, the mask will "pause" the sound as it tries to reconnect to the audio source (my phone), which is less that a foot away, on my nightstand, and the sound "stutters" with increasing frequency until it's stuttering CONSTANTLY. Needless to say this is unacceptable. My other sleep mask connects, and STAYS connected, without any issue. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this sleep mask.
