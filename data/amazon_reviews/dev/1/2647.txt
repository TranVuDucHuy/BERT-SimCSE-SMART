It did not work on my BMW so I tried it on another car and it worked. Then, I traded in my other car for another BMW and tried it on the new BMW and it does not work. I then tried to contact their customer service via phone and waited a long time on hold so decided to request a call back (it's an option on their customer service where they will call you once your place in line is reached). It's been over 24 hours and no one has called back. I also tried their "Live Chat" on two different days and it does not work - it says "a live agent is coming" and no one comes. Seems a defective product at least for BMWs and not mentioned in their marketing. Also, their customer service is a joke.
