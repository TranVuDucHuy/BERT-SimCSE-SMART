Overall probably one of the worst purchases I've ever made on Amazon. When I received the product I went ahead and put all the pieces to charge for the night. The next day I noticed one of the mics was still dead, while the other had a full battery. I put it to charge again and I noticed it came on when it was plugged into the charger but the minute that it was disconnected the device would turn off and would not come on.I left it charging when I went to work and when I returned the same thing was happening the mic was not retaining the charge. I tried updating the software and still nothing, then the second mic started having problems and would not connect to the receiver. So now I'm sitting there with 2 useless mics and one receiver that won't connect to them. Thankfully it happened within the timeframe when I can return it and get my money back.My recommendation is not to buy from this seller, because this is not the first time something like this has happened. There are other people who have bought from them and had the same issue.
