OK, so I just unpacked the box for the D610BT and THERE IS NO CASE! The picture on Amazons Website CLEARLY SHOWS A CASE. Having a protective storage case was one of the reasons I purchased this version of the label printer when my old battery operated P-Touch label maker just stopped working.I generally like Brother products but the sellers of this particular machine are not being honest when they show photo's of a product that has parts THANT ARE NOT INCLUDED!BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING AND LIES!
