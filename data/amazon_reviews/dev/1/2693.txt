This is a very attractive multi-outlet box with three USB ports. All the outlets are spaced nicely and are usable unless power adapters are plugged in. Unfortunately the USB ports are NOT well made. Both USB-B type ports are not aligned properly with the box's opening and are un-usable, my USB cables will not fit! The USB port has a very loose fit and cables will detach on their own too easily. Overall I cannot recommend this unit because of its poor construction tolerances.
