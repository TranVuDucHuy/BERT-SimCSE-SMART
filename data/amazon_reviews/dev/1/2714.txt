I had high hopes for SM57 based on all the reviews. Not sure if it is a one-off issue but the product that I received has turned out to be a lemon. The sound coming out of it is so feeble while recording acoustic guitar. I tried switching my xlr cable etc. but no hope. Unfortunately my Amazon return window is already past before I could put my hands on this. I will try to reach out to Shure customer service and see if anything could be done.
