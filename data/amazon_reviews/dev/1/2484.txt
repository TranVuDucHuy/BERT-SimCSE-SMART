I loved the fit and that they had multiple sizes for the ear bud. I have small ears so I tend to go for the smallest ones. I also liked how lonf the battery lasted. I am saying that they are trash because the right earphone does not work well with phone calls! Mic is horrible! My call was a static mess and the person on the other end kept telling me that I was cutting in and out and that it sounded like I was in a tunnel under water. I took the headphones out and switched to my phone and there wasn't any static. I am really disappointed with these and am sending them back. Sound like you guys don't care about your customers since there are several others that have said the same thing about your product. Thumbs down.
