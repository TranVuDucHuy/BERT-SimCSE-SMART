These earbuds fall out of my ears easily. All of the controls are very sensitive and anytime I touched my ear it changed. It either turned the earbuds off, turned the volume up, turned the volume down, skipped to the next song, etc. Don't waste your money. Sometimes you get what you pay for and this time I did.
