This microphone is counterfeit. At least the one I received is. The box has typos all over it and the mic feels fake and plastic is a slightly different color. Also the Shure bag is super black and shiny. I have a ton of Shure mic bags and they are all slightly grey and matte finish. Don't be fooled.
