Looks like this stand was made with good intentions, but missed on a major factor that makes it useless. The hinge and general build are nice. But, when interacting with the phone while on the stand even the lightest pressure on the screen makes the stand rock back. Every touch creates a tipping and release that makes noise and doesn't allow for ease of use. Also, the bright logo front and center on the base of the black version is very annoying. This was a good attempt, but an unusable product. I do not recommend. Disappointed that I spent money on this stand.
