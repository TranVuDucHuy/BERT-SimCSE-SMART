Mine lasted 7 months before the mic quit. This was a headset that sat on my desk when I wasn't using it, and I used it for a small number of calls per day.Then one day, people started saying, "Hello? Hello?" when I called. Nobody can hear me.This device is way too expensive to last less than a year.
