Putting the headset inside the case ensures a charge will be happening. Sadly, using the stand-up option on the travel charger does not ensure a good connection, even when actively trying to get it right and make it charge. I've tried several different approach angles and it is just a pain to get it to charge, which you need to do often because this is NOT an all day battery. I end up bending it around for storage and putting it inside the case often. A dead headset is so frustrating.Why can't this be USB-C? Also, no wireless charging? These things should be standard on a device like this. The desk charger from an older Voyager Legend does not work with this headset, the shape has been changed too much for it to even graze the charging pins. I knew these things when I bought it, but they have bugged more than I expected.Edit: Another dead headset on Monday morning. Not only is it frustrating to not have a working headset, I worry it will damage the battery over time. Maybe the stand-alone charger base would charge more reliably, not sure if I want to drop more money on this.
