Don't be fooled. It looked rugged and I thought since It was one of the most expensive, I expected quality. Instead, It is cheap plastic. It's bulky but it holds surprisingly very little. The first day it fell off twice putting it and my phone in my pocket. I tried to put just 3 folded bills in it, and it snapped the rubber holder. I'd find another, I did.
