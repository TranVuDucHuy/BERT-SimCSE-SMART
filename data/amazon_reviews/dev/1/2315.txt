Update - I have used this headset on-and-off for over a year. Today it cut out in the middle of a meeting. it still powers on and can be put into pairing mode, but none of my devices are able to connect with it. Hoping to resolve, or will need to junk and buy something different.After several days' use, here are the key pros and cons I have noticed.Pros:1. Exceptional sound quality. I use this for virtual meetings, and have heard from my colleagues that the sound is clear.2. Excellent noise cancellation. Again, feedback from colleagues is that they hear ZERO background noise, even when I intentionally played background noise to see if they could hear it.3. Batter life so far has lasted a full day of meetings.4. Easy pairing.5. Responsive service from Angeela.Cons:1. The headset seems designed for smaller heads, so it has been a struggle getting a good fit. I'm getting there with little adjustments each day.2. I cannot figure out how to get the headset to pair to two devices such that I can switch from one to the other with a push of a button, as described in the features. It pairs with multiple devices, but does not switch from one to the other without first disabling it in the first device. That's not a huge deal for me, but something to pay attention to.Overall first impression - a quality product I hope to use for a long time.
