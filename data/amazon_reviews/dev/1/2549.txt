They started out OK. Sound quality left much to be desired, but I was willing to compromise for the bluetooth ability. Well, after about 4-6 hours of usage the headphones began to distort and glitch the audio. Plugging the headphones in seemed to remedy this issue, but defeats the point of buying them for bluetooth, and also they can't charge and play audio from the audio jack connection. If you want a pair of headphones, especially bluetooth ones, you're better off looking elsewhere.
