Purchased, according to Amazon records, January, 2019. Failed to connect as an external file transfer device. I am unclear as to the actual cause. I have been using similar cables for many more years than this one. "Unhappy camper" is a fair description of my feelings about this cable.Request for "Charging power" set at 1 star to get this review submitted, but I really am unsure that's a fair rating.
