After 5 years, I give up. Thought there would be special magic and versatility by spending the extra money for the seemingly fabulous fine-tuning/enhancing voodoo "mojo" knob and switches. First sign of possible "mistake! wasted money!" was the inexplicably nebulous nature of the nice smooth Control Knob: adjusts impedance AND simultaneously the bass roll off/tonal balance when that high-pass switch is engaged? Huh? Found the main effect was introducing varying degrees of Additional hum and buzz with a little added RF/ambient Hiss to the signal. Careful orientation far from everything else helps, but still. NONE of that unwanted noise is heard through the basic CL-1 and CL-2 boxes I absolutely love. Not to mention they just sound as good and clean as can be, without variation or exception, no matter what Dynamic/Ribbon element mic is plugged in. Other "red flag" I should have picked up on: the "cute" level pad switch labeled "Max" and "More". So WTF is that supposed to mean: You switch between "More than straight mic output" with the option to go all the way to Maximum capability? Or is average boosted output called "Max", and you have the option to add even "More"? Yeah, you can figure it out by listening to the difference, but it's still hyperbolic kitschy BS labeling for a serious purely plain utility pro audio tool. Anyway - don't waste your money. Just get a regular Cloudlifter box - it's great. And solidly reliable. Or maybe spend a bit more for the new Royer non-powered mic signal booster, which I'm about to do, because I trust the company for ultimate quality. Not that there's a thing wrong with a CL-1 or 2. But most likely the Royer R-DB20 for a bit more will actually perform up to the excellence specs promised by this lousy overpriced CL-Z nonsense box. I'll be happy if it's only slightly more excellent than a plain ol' Cloudlifter.
