I bought this adapter to connect my 2011 MacBook to the tv and to a second monitor at my desk. It worked great for one day, and then it totally quit working. When I would plug it into my laptop, the laptop display would change to reflect that it was sending a signal to the second display, but the display wasn't receiving any signal. Tried it with my monitor, the TV, and my husband's fancy desk monitor, and all of them had the same problem. Total dud. Wouldn't recommend buying this product.
