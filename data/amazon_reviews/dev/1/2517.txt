Heard a lot of good things about Raycon so I figured I give them a try. These are probably the most frustrating wireless earbuds I've ever owned. Constantly Dropping connection with my device. Not wanting to charge or recognize the charger. I threw them away today and will go back to my beloved JayBirds. I've had several pairs of the Jaybirds which would great and trouble free.
