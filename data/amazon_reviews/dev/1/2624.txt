I was sent a broken SD card. It was cracking at the top right where the slant is at and the sticker was off when I opened the package. I would definitely send it back if I could, but by the time I had noticed I had already thrown away the package and cannot retrieve it. Fortunately it was spare money I had lying around so no big deal. Just careful who you buy from, I'm sure this does work, but I'm the unfortunate fellow who got a broken card.
