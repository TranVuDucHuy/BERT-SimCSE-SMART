did not fix the printer in fact made it worse one of the cartridges was printing then stopped and leaked ink all over , so now i have to trash a expensive printer, keyboard and wireless mouse which i loves, i got ink on some of my DJ mixers and on my iPhone, have severe damage to my desk all these thing i might've to trash because the ink wont come off. This product "saves" you money but in the end i am having to trash about $800 of den, iPad and iPhone, computer, and desk. I cant even deal with how this seller is going to go about to fix this, tried the cartridges on another printer it did the same thing but it was a smaller model for these cartridges and lucking we stopped dit and flipped it tasing down and the ink wa stunning g into the b.g like black blood. switched to HP INSTA INK printers and been happy with them i have 2 different models and i get ink whenim low automatically,
