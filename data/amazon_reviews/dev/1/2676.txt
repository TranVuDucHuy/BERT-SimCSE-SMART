The biggest issue with this is that if you have more than 2 cards in your wallet, it’s very difficult to take them out. I found it very frustrating carrying 3 cards and not being able to take one quickly. While the magnet is pretty strong and secure, the issue with being able to access the cards is a complete deal breaker for me. I’ve returned this and have received a refund. I do not recommend this for anyone carrying 3 cards.
