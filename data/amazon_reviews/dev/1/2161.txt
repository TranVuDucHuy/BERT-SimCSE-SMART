These headphones were okay until one earbud stopped working. I've had battery issues with Anker wireless headphones before and unfortunately this pair has been no different. Unfortunately Anker doesn't stand by the quality of their products and only offers a 30 day refund policy, after which you can only get replacements. Given that the last time I had this issue with Anker I went through multiple replacements whose batteries all failed within months of using them before finally buying some direct from China generics that functioned better I'm not hopeful this time either.Also worth noting that, while they were functioning, I found it hard to get a secure fit despite trying multiple heads, especially when I'd built up a sweat while running.
