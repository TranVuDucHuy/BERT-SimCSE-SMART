It's kind of hard to see what's going on in the picture included but basically when I put a sheet in it gets jammed. It just doesn't come out the other side and crinkles up what is in there. I learned from a previous experience with a different brand so I put a practice sheet in and it came out a little crinkly. I also put 2 blank sheets in and they totally jammed up. I'm glad they didn't ruin my laminator.
