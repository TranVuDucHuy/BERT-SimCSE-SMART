I've had these headphones now for 3 years and decided it's about time to write a review. These headphones have served me through thick and thin and for the price you are paying serve their purpose wonderfully. To start off with the noise cancellation, these headphones are not the best for that, and I feel like there is definitely better products out there if noise cancelling is your primarily goal. I couldn't even say that the noise cancelling is good, if you are in a moderately filled room, they may serve you well enough so you can't clearly make out any words, but you'll still hear stuff. I'm going to void over the noise quality as my experience in this department is really small, but I mean you'll hear stuff, and you'll enjoy your music comfortably. Lastly, and this is single handedly my biggest issue with this headset, battery life. It has a great battery life, I often forget to charge it just due to how long it lasts me. I am a college student who enjoys skateboarding and my quiet studying time, so I am always using these headphones, you'll never find me without them on my college campus. The issue that stems from the battery life is its on-board battery reminder. The headphones will ENSURE you are aware of their current battery life, every few minutes you will be hit with the blaringly loud, annoying, and intrusive reminder that your headset has 6-12 hours of battery life or less than 6 hours. Not the best and most specific way to inform the user of the battery life. This friendly reminder will interrupt anything and everything you are listening too without fail and it will do it fairly consistently over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, prior to this review I had an online meeting and half of my meeting was interrupted by the constant reminder saying, "6 to 12 hours play time". This won't shut off your music, video, or call but it will loudly interrupt it. Other than that, I highly recommend this headset for its price range though if you have the money for something better, please get something better.
