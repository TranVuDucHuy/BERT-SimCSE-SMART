I love the colors, which is why I purchased the cases. I thought for sure the key ring would be a carabiner clip, like most other cases sold on the market today. Instead it's a very cheap fake metal key ring that makes it extremely difficult to use for the air tag for other than keys. Not practical! I had to spend money on buying additional carabiners. I'm not sure why this product is an amazon choice product, as you can buy a similar 4 pack with the correct type of key ring for the same or less price on amazon.
