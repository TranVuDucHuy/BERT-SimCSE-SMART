Not a bad product, but it could have been so much better. It uses Velcro to hold the two ends together. For most purposes, that probably works, but maybe not if your coil of cord is very heavy. I did not realize it was going to be Velcro, or I would not have bought it. I thought the end with the grommet would slip through a slot in the belt itself. I think that would have been a much better design. That said, the straps are good quality.
