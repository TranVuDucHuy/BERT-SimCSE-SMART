The preamp wasn't as quiet as I had hoped. There was a hum and background noise that was introduced into the audio signal that wasn't there before. I tried several cables, but the hum persisted. The mic has the Rode podcast dynamic that went to the "cloud lifter" to a Tascam HR 2x2 interface. The hum disappeared with the removal of the cloud lifter, but I was stuck with a low input signal which I was trying to overcome.I have taken an older Peavey 6 channel mixer and inserted this in the place of the cloudlifter. This overcame the low input signal with no background noise. So the chain now is Rode podcas mic, Peavey mixer, Tascam HR2x2 computer interface. The cloudlifter is going to the unused gear shelf for now.
