Despite being listed as "compatible" with Samsung phones it DOES NOT work with Samsung's proprietary "super fast charging" protocol. It doesn't matter what cable you use, car off or running, etc. It just would not "super fast charge" my new Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. I reached out to Anker support to see if I received a defective product and received a response stating that it's not defective and they know it doesn't work to "super fast charge" Samsung phones.I returned it and bought a nearly identical charger from my phone manufacturer for just a few bucks more.
