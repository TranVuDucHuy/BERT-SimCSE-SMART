The sound quality is so fantastic for this price. Also the option to use USB or XLR is insane. Good at canceling out background noise and comes with it's own wind screen! You do need to be pretty close to the mic for it to pic up your voice. I keep it about half a feet away but the closer the more rich the sound will be. Definitely recommend and will buy again. I keep it on a boom stand from Neewer and it works great. Love the on and off feature for quick mute and the set up is as easy as plugging it in!If this was helpful please hit the helpful button, thank you!EDIT:I use Windows 10 and Everytime I turn on my PC I get an insane amount of static. You won't even be able to hear yourself so you'll need to unplug the replug the mic. This is a big draw back because the constant replugging will wear the cable down over time and eventually the mic port. I'm ASSUMING getting XLR box / using this feature will probably fix the problem but I have not tried as I don't have the XLR box. If I find a fix I will change my review back to 5 stars and tell everyone how to fix it.P.S may other people have had this problem with no fix.
