I have an unusual use for this cable. A few years ago the stoner rock/doom metal band The Sword released an album called Used Future. I got a rare collector's edition of that album on what is essentially a flash drive built into an old 8-track tape. It contains an audio-visual version of the album that is unavailable elsewhere plus a couple of extras. If you look at the attached photo you will see where the USB plug sticks out of the 8-track tape cartridge. It doesn't stick out far enough to fit into the USB slot on a computer. That's why I bought this cable. One end goes onto the flash drive/tape thing, and the other end goes into my desktop PC.It works but is unfortunately incredibly slow. A 9 foot cable is generally considered too long to charge a phone. It's also too long to efficiently plug in a USB drive. When playing video files off the drive they are extremely laggy. Copying the files to the PC is extremely slow.This is a very well-built cable. Both male and female ends fit snugly and easily. But because USB is such a low-voltage signal, this cable is much too long for most uses. I definitely don't recommend it for use with a flash drive or other external drive unless you can't find anything shorter.
