The mic runs great, but unfortunately they gloss over one major issue. If windows ever updates on your PC and you happen to be using the mic with the USB, your USB port will then fail to recognize your mic upon reboot. Fortunately they do have a firmware update that they neglect to ever mention needing that fixes this issue. However unfortunately this will only work if you didn't make the common mistake of using the mic on another USB port and that failing as well before you realized that the issue was with the mic itself. Having no USB ports able to recognize the mic means you can't get the firmware update unless using an entirely different PC to run it, and even then that may not fix the issue effectively killing the product.
