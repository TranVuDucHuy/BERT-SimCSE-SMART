I bought a second one I love it so much. But recently one of them started to smell like burning. It was so hot I couldn’t touch it. Both usb ports burned. I had to throw it out. It shouldn’t have happened only my laptop and iPhone was plugged in. So beware. I don’t know what I did wrong to have this happen.
