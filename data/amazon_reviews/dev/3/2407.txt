I keep this in a charger by my couch, so anyone who comes over can charge their phone, so it's more occasionally used than frequently.After about 6 months, the 1st cable became flaky and started only working sometimes -- swapped out the cable / tried that cable in another charger and the problem follows the cable.So reliability is a long term concern!
