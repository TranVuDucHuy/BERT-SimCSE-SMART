I've had these headphones for 15 months now. Battery and sound quality have been consistent. However, my least favorite thing about these headphones is that they were designed to connect to one device at a time.What I mean is the following. I use these with three devices: 1. my macbook 2. my ipad 3. my iphone. If they're connected to my laptop while working, and I want to use them to workout, I need to go into my laptop bluetooth settings and disconnect,, and then go into the other device to connect them. The only exception is if, for example, you have the headphones connected to your laptop, and actually leave your home, creating distance from the device, where the headphones disconnect by themselves from the first device, allowing you to connect to your other device.This constant dance, of disconnecting and connecting, becomes incredibly annoying over time. By contrast, apple airpods allow you to connect to two devices at a time. While that's still inconvenient when you actively use 3 of 4 devices, it significantly reduces the amount of times you need to do this switching.I don't think it presents a huge engineering problem for the manufacturers to allow connections to at least 2 devices. If they could do that, this would be a hell of a deal for $80 dollars.
