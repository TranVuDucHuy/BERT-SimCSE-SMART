I got this because I have a 1TB external SSD that I use on multiple computers every day. I wanted to use this cable for my home PC. However, it will not load any files on my SSD and actually almost corrupted my entire drive. DON'T USE THIS FOR LARGER STORAGE DEVICES. If you're just using it for a smaller storage device, it works just fine.
