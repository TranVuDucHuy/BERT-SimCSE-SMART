I edited the below a week later: It did indeed fit our Subaru, but with a super hard push. My guess is that the two contact points had super hard springs and that pushing into the Honda soften them enough to work. I suggest protecting the contacts on the side with a towel or heavy cloth the then using pliers to repeatedly squeeze the springs. I did not try the Volks, as I didn't see the need to.Original:And, did not fit into a 3-in-one adapter I had and which works fine. However, it did fit, with hard push into socket of 2016 Honda CRV. All these car chargers should have more info on what they do and don't fit, or give exact dimensions for the device.I did not test the output, assuming it is fine, based on reviews. If I detect a problem in the future, I'll revise this. Though, I wonder how many will read my remarks, because of the large number of other reviews.
