Pros:-The sound quality is really excellent. these are some of the best sounding headphones I've ever had. I've heard the fancy Sony WH-1000XM4's and I like the sound on these much better.-The noise cancelation is also very good. Maybe not as good as the Sony or Bose but still quite good.-The build quality is also very good. It's mostly plastic, but it feels pretty solid and I'm not worried it's gonna break. The ear cops also have a nice soft faux leather on them.-I saw some reviews that said that the layout of the control buttons was confusing, but I did not find that to be the case. Once I acclimated to it, it was totally fine.-It paired to my phone and laptop very easily.-The battery also last a long time. I use these everyday for my commute and I can go over a week between charges.-They fold up very nicely for storage.Cons:-The ear cups are small and will not fit completely over your ears unless you have the smallest ears in the world. I've tried on other over the ear headphones that had alot more space for your ears. These will sit on your ears and that can be quite uncomfortable.-The headband has very little padding and it can hurt the top of your head .-The side tone(which pipes in ambient noise so you can hear your surroundings) is annoying. When you are listening on your phone, you can turn it off though the app. But I have not figured out how to turn it off when I pair with my laptop, so these headphones are super annoying to use for zoom meetings on my laptop for work.-When you are connected to two devices via Bluetooth and then turn one of them off or go out of range, you get an annoying "disconnected" message that repeats over and over until you turn them off and restart.-If you want to connect them to a device via a wire you need a specific cord, you can't just use any 3.5mm cord.-Although you can move the ear cups around a little bit, they cannot fol flat. This means that if you take the headphones off your head and are wearing them around your neck, the ear cups stick up and hit you in the chin, which is annoying.Overall: These are my first over-ear headphones. I usually prefer on-ears, but it seems that many companies seem to be phasing out the on-ears in favor of over the ears so the on-ears are harder to find. Also the sound quality in over-ears is supposed to be better. But I have to say that after trying these for about 6 months I am giving up on them and am going to go back to on ears. I love the sound, but they are just too uncomfortable for me and hurt my ears and head after about an hour. Also, I wear glasses and the over-ears press against the ear pieces, which is very uncomfortabke. I really wanted to love these because they sound so good, but the discomfort is just not worth it.
