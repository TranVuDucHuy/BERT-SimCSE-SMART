SO to begin with, 13" must be tip to tip. There is no way this strap is going around an item 13" in circumference. Secondly, I don't see the point of making this from HD strapping - The velcro will give way LONG before a lighter strap would. These are a good idea, and make for convenient stowage of lighter items, but didnt work for my purposes (I overestimated the holding power of velcro)
