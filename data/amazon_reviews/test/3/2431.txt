The Good:I like the sound quality and the ANC works well (couldn't hear my wife yelling down the stairs to me though, which ticked her off.....). The controls are reasonably intuitive and I mostly like the multipoint connection - it switched between my computer and phone pretty seamlessly. Stop playing music on one and start it on the other, and the headphones automatically switch sources. I haven't had problems with battery life.The bad:1) Not very comfortable. They squeeze fairly hard which gives me headaches and the ear cups are on the small side which hurt my ears after a bit. I can only wear them for 2-3hrs before I have to take them off.2) Doesn't play nice with MS Teams. When connected via bluetooth they cause MS Teams (for work & school) to crash. Not sure about Teams for personal use. Teams works fine with other bluetooth headsets, with wired headsets, and with the built-in laptop speakers. However, if I try to make a Teams call when these headphones when connected via bluetooth, Teams crashes, my computer thinks it has no audio output devices at all, and I can't listen to music, play videos, make calls, etc using *any* audio output devices until I restart my computer. These headphones *do* work fine with Zoom. I contacted Sennheiser support, and they suggested updating the firmware to the November 2022 version. This didn't fix the problem and they didn't have any other ideas.3) Phone call quality kinda sucks. Tinny, the incoming audio cuts out from time to time, and there's a distracting ambient audio pass-through that is distracting (it amplifies little sounds).Bottom line is that I'm returning them as soon as the other headphones I ordered arrive.
