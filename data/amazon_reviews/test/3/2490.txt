Â Those ads about "top Christmas gifts"... yeah, I read several of them. One finally convinced me to buy a few products.I'm not impressed with this charger, but it'll do while I'm at the office. I have to remove my phone case & it charges slowly. I have a Samsung galaxy s21 ultra.In our house, we have 1 Samsung, 2 iPhone, and 2 other androids. This charger doesn't work with the Android phones, a Motorola & an LG. Make sure your phone has wireless charging capabilities, which probably should be mentioned in the listing.
