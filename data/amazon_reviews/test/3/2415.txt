This court is worked well for me up until now. Suddenly my one cord does not charge my iPhone any longer. Thereâ€™s no visible damage to the cord and other prongs work. I have tried only charging with the iPhone prong while the other prongs are not charging but it still does not charge. There should be no reason that the cord does not work. My iPhone chargers with other power cords with the same port
