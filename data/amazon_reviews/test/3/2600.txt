The tips on the pentalobes in my set were fairly rounded off, and not square at all. Absolutely trashed the screws on the macbook I was working on. 50% worked fine, but even with even easy pressure they stripped out too many screws. Nothing more frustrating than a imprecise tool on precise parts. Bits are a bit loose in the driver, not terrible, but not well made.3/5 because the rest of the tool set is fine for my purposes.iFIXIT work on your QC!!!
