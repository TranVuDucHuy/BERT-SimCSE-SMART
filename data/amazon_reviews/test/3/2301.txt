For users that have problems with the original Apple silicone earbud tips, this might be a solution. In my case the tips did not fit as well or have consist noise cancellation that the originals had. I could also see for a user that these foam tips, the tips will absorb sweat and oils from the userâ€™s ear For a user that is allergic to silicone, this product might be a solution.Not a bad product, but not for me.
