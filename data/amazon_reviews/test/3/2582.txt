Just as good as the toner that came out of the box. Lie most printer supplies the price point is a little much, but it's still cheaper overall than getting an inkjet printer and replacing the ink. Honestly, Amazon sells generic toner that is cheaper and works just as well. I'd go and purchase that instead.
