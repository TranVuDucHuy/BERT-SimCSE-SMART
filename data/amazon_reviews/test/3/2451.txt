I was under the impression that this splitter would be able to allow audio from any cord with a lightning end, however that is not the case. I have a lightning to av cord and it is not supported. If I use a dongle to an av cord, it works fine. I personally hate using dongles bc they wear out so often and need to be replaced. Just wanted to give a warning to others that literally only a dongle and only headphones will work for the audio capabilities.
