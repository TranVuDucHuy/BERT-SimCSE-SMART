I already have a great charger that I purchased directly from Apple for my iPhone. That charger charges quickly but the only real issue I have (if I were to call it an 'issue') is that I can only charge one device at a time.The entire reason I bought this, and what I thought I was getting when I bought this, was a device that can quickly charge more than one Apple device at a time (say, both your phone + airpods, simultaneously).But as you can clearly see with me showing even my smallest chargeable device (Airpod Pros) -- even small headphones occupy all the charge space this device can offer at one time.This version costs more than its predecessor by at least $10, and I don't see why, because it's still only charging one device at a time.The [small] charging device here looks nice, it charges fine, but what I dislike the most is it only charges one device at a time and that is simply not the solution I was looking for and is not what I thought I'd have when I bought this. I want fewer cords and more efficient solutions for my tech -- not yet more cords and more clutter.I'm returning this item for precisely this reason and will be back on the market seeking something that can charge several devices at a time.
