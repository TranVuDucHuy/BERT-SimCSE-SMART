I'm kind of disappointed, I felt like this would be the penultimate of precision kits based on other reviews and the price, but it feels like I'm just paying for a fancy case. Nice but selection, sturdy handle, but the metal for the bits does seem a little soft and the magnetism is really weak. Meanwhile I bought a kit with the same amount of bits, tweezers, and a magnetizer for the half the price and it seems to works just as well, if not better. I just don't see any way to justify a $30 price tag for a completely average kit.
