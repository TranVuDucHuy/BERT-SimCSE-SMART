I bought this device on March 29, 2022. Today (May 18, 2022 - about 45 days later) I got a notification saying my batter is almost dead (between 0% and 5%). This is INSANE considering the ad states it's a 6 month battery. I contacted Samsung customer support, and they tried the whole "No, the Amazon page says it can last UP TO 6 months"", which I promptly corrected them by showing them that the page clearly says it lasts 6 months.I am not unreasonable, I could understand if it only lasted 4-5 months due to use conditions, but 45 days is totally unacceptable, and from the other reviews, I am far from the first person to have this issue.On top of the battery issue, the "Search Nearby" function performs at a beta level at best. I can literally have my phone touching the tag, and it will say I am 3 feet away from it.Samsung really needs to get their act together. They are one of the biggest tech companies in the world, they don't HAVE to cut corners or lie, but they do to make more money for their executives. Late stage capitalism at it's finest....
