I had heard differing opinions on whether this could help lower noise, so I decided to do my own (amateur) test on this.I recorded a quick voice sample on my phone, and played it back at the outer reaches of what the Shure would pick up, at the distance when background noise starts to become a real issue (~2ish ft). (Yes, I'm aware for real voice recording you'd want to be much closer than this, but the vast majority of time I just use this mic for Discord chats and I tend to sit back in my chair so I wanted to see if this product could help with that.) I then recorded to Audacity, and used software amplify to bring them all up to consistent volumes so the speaking would be consistently loud across all the tests.The first two test cases really show I think the intended use of this product -- if you're plugging directly into an audio interface like the Focusrite Scarlet Solo, then it WILL reduce noise notably. In my test, a clearly audible 6db improvement.However, if you're already using something to boost gain (in my case, a 15 year old Behringer mixer), you might not actually notice any real improvement. I did notice the Cloudlifter changed the tone of the noise versus either of the other two tests which was a bit worrying as to why it made it sound different, though I can see that might be a personal preference to some folks.Ultimately, for the price and the hype, I expected the Cloudlifter to net out an improvement versus just matching my current equipment. Especially considering cost -- both the cloudlifter and my mixer cost roughly equivalent amounts, but the mixer has a whole bunch more features.That said, the Cloudlifter does seem extremely solidly built and was simple to set up. It does seem like a good product, I just don't know if it's competitive versus other options (and the tonal shift was odd, too).
