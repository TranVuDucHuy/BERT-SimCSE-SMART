I've now bought many different cables under the amazon basics brand, and it comes down to this.There is almost an exact 50/50 chance your cables will work, or suck.In reference to these usb extenders, one worked fine. The second couldn't handle a headset plugged in, and would actual heat up when used for power. The quality is exactly what you pay for, and runs the edge of worth it when you have to toss half your product due to connection, transfer, or even safety concerns. This has also happened on USB-C cables, HDMI, and USB 3.0 Cables I have gotten.Either way still an okay product, I recommend you test the cables before using them for power, or running them in hard to reach places.
