Reviews differed on whether this stand is truly swivel-able. The manufacturer answered this way to this question in the Q&A - the stand is NOT for "on-going swivel". The instruction states you need to loosen the bolt connecting the upper bar to the pillar, adjust the angle, and retighten it. In another word, the upper bar is meant to stay fixed to the pillar in daily use without movement.That said, plenty of people commented they can swivel the tv. You can also see that in several youtube videos on the product as well. It's really up to individuals to decide whether they are comfortable to go against the manufacturer's instruction or not. Personally, I'm not betting the safety of an expensive equipment on an unadvised function and I hope they have made the difference clear in the product description.
