The noice cancellation is atrocious. If there is any sound, you’ll still hear. It’s actually more of a nuisance than a useful feature. At the gym, every time my feet hit the ground when running on the treadmill, the NC noise is so far behind I thought something was wrong with them. It sounded like something was loose inside the buds but it was just the super delayed NC. I can hear people and music across the other side of the gym, even with NC and music on.The sound quality is good and manageable in the app and the battery life is good as well.If you plan on using these out and about, in the gym, etc I wouldn’t even bother if NC is what you’re basing your decision on.I got them for sale and still doubt if they are worth it.
