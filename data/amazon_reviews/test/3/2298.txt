I wanted to like this product as it had good 5 star reviews and because I use my AirPods quite a bit/which I already have a love-hate relationship with.The item installation was easy and the idea seems pretty straightforward, however I’m not sure if the buds work as intended or my airpod buds have already been damaged for the way I wear them.First of all, the AirPods passed the sound test initially. The left ear fit seems okay, it doesn’t feel like it’s gonna fall out or anything. However the right ear sometimes feels like it’s going to fall out. I thought this product my fix that. I would definitely never do high intensity cardio with these earbuds in.I’ve tried all three sizes and even tried a different size on my right side, but got frustrated and gave up. I will continue to use the original ear buds and chalk these up to a waste of money.I wouldn’t recommend, but I guess you could always try them yourself or send them back it you didn’t like the fit.
