I was getting extremely frustrated with all of my chargers going bad and decided to get this. Yes, you still need to plug your charger into the wireless charger, but the fact that I can just place my phone on the charger instead of plugging it in was a win for me. I do not like how it takes longer to charge my phone and that is somewhat frustrating. I have even tried using different charging chords for the wireless charger and it didn't change the charge time.
