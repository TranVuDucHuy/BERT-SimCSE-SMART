The first thing I noticed is that the large size do not allow the Air Pods to sit properly in the charging case. In short, the charger door doesn’t close all the way. Secondly, they fit well until they didn’t. The ear piece separates from the Air Pods and get stuck in my ear. Not a fan and will look for a better alternative.
