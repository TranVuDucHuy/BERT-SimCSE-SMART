I enjoyed music quality and comfort as well as BT5.0 and USB C charging. Battery life is solid and it is easy to pair and use. Some call the controls complicated and though I agree the play/pause button isn't well done, I adjusted in a few days and was mostly fine. I did contact support for help with my issues. None was available.I'm returning this product for the following reasons, in no particular order. I don't recommend you purchase these unless they fall under $100 or you are fine with the issues.1. ANC toggles on and off with the push of a button for a purple indicator light. You get a second or two where the audio drops out while this kicks in. Or maybe off. There is no indication, on the headphones or app, that say ANC is on or off. the light toggles purple either way. You can guess given ambient noise but you'll never know! There is no known fix for this or support had no input.2. ANC seems to kick in for calls with something they call sidetone. It pipes in ambient audio so you can hear yourself and not be too loud. Except, I just hear everything except the call. Call audio drops below ambient noise, even just working in the kitchen or tasks where a speakerphone might cut it. So these are useless to me on calls and I redirect to the headset I am trying to replace. It might as well not have call options at all. No fix or patch coming as far as support has said.3. If you pair this to 2 devices, say your phone and a laptop, you have to be careful to disconnect when you go out of range of 1 device. If you do walk away or go on a walk, you will need to power off the headphones then power them back on and connect to the 1 device (out of range of the other device). Otherwise, you will have a nice British voice say 'Disconnected' every 5 seconds. No, the device does not reconnect when back in range, at least not reliably for me to notice it tried to. There is also no fix for this though it's entirely software...With that in mind, are these a good fit? For about $100 I'd probably keep them but need a second headset of the same type for calls, making them effectively useless if the other set has noise cancelling and decent audio. There may not be better headphones at that price range either, feature wise. I appreciate USB C. The audio cable it comes with works well though may be short for large desk spaces. Battery life is great as I went maybe 4 days straight with extended use before charging, but not because they needed a charge. They are comfortable on my head, though some may find the top band a bit thin.
