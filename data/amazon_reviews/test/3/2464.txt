The largest the clamp will hold is 3.5" . It advertises 3.5 - 6-5" device compatible. Not true. Fortunately, it fits my iPhone XS in a case. It takes some finger strength to remove my phone from the clamp when I want to take if off. It would not fit my iPad.Other than that, the item is good. It was easy to set up, feels sturdy enough, but if I were to put it up on a shelf for added height, I'd put a weight on the base. I like the goose neck and the ease of changing the angle. I can point it up, down, side or other side. Some other stands looked like the movement choices would be more limited. I like it and will keep it, I just wish the clamp would open wider as described.
