I used this for splitting a USB port on my VR headset so I can listen to the game and use the port for something else tooIt's very good, but do NOT use with headphones, as every once in a while it will have some sort of connection issue or something like that and create corrupted-like sounds that could damage your headphones, hearing, or both. Luckily, neither my hearing nor headphones have been damaged, but very loud sounds have been made.
