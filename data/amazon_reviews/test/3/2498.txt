I purchased this specifically for traveling since, well, it has multiple outlets which would mean I don't have to haul several charges along. Of course, I didn't notice with all the description that it doesn't support 220V which is absurd since all modern chargers you receive with a laptop/phone etc you'd want to replace with this one, actually do. I don't know why they even bothered making this one.
