I bought this a few months ago (November 2022) and I've been using it every workday since. It charges great, seems well made, and is really a nice looking product. I just noticed today that it has developed a crack in the top glass part. I don't think I've been rough putting my phone on and off of it, and the charging still works, so I will continue to use it for now, but I'm sort of bummed out by the crack.
