Affordably great at $24.99 discounted, a bit overpriced at $36.00When I hit the road and want a speaker to 'throw in the suitcase" I use my trusty Satechi Divoom (now out of print) or something like this:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E738RUK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1There's always that longing however for what I call the "Plunk It Down, Instant Party" STEREO speaker box.This is 6.5" LONG2 & 5/8" DEEP (thick front to back)2 & 3/4" TALLIt has some heft / weight to it. I will probably think twice before throwing it in my suitcase for a traveling light trip. I'm going to guess it weights 12 oz to 1lb. If anyone has bothered to weigh it, let me know.PROS: I had the DOSS at 100% internal volume and my FIIO X3 MP3 player at 85% volume, it got substantially loud in an uncarpeted 14 X 14 office room. I did not hear any major clipping or speaker breakup. It has enough bass that you can feel the top half of the deep synth snarl in Coldplay's "Army Of One". It did not walk around on the table during that test - stayed put.CONS: The highs are fairly directional. It took me a few minutes to realize the midrange is * slightly * nasal / veiled / smeared. Unlike my son-in-law's Foxx (brand) speaker which I covet, the highs and the mids on this Doss are not as effortlessly "rich" or clear. The mid / high frequencies are certainly perfunctory / presentable if a bit ...dry? This is an initial impression. BUT REMEMBER - IT'S A THIRTY DOLLAR ITEM. What do I expect? (Everything! but let's not go there...)On the other hand, the Foxx speaker my relative has was probably more expensive.(His model is out of print, it's a bit smaller than this unit but correspondingly probably has less bass).SUGGESTION: If you buy this, put it in a corner shelf about 4 to 4.5 feet off the ground. You'll get the optimum bass "oomph" out of it and gain more audible high frequency output.My saga of eternal torment: So I buy this on a "discount" at $30.99 and 2 days later it drops down to $24.99. Auuugh!INTANGIBLES: I own a lot of stereo equipment. Part of the appeal with this was: I was thrilled to NOT have to buy another black box with square corners audio (or anything!) device. So yeah, they got me with the cute little blue speaker.OTHER FEATURES: Water Resistance, if real, is nothing to sneeze at - a Plus. I have yet to test that. The TF (MicroSD) card reader - meh, it's a frill, but hey it's free for those who want to hassle with it navigating songs with no display. It has a beentsy charge indicator light but it won't be obnoxious in a dark room.ACCESSORIES: DOSS provides in the box a Micro USB cord, a 3.5 mm stereo audio cord, and a dark charcoal colored faux leather drawstring pouch for the whole shebang.DISCLAIMER: I tested with the 3.5mm cord. I personally never use bluetooth as there's always some compromise, in either sound or your sanity. I'm old skool OK? Unapologetic. It's simpler for me to just plug the damn thing in.BOTTOM LINE: It's a decent value at $24.99. It's an "OK" buy at $30.99. It's a bit overpriced at $36.00 It's not a BEOLIT, neither is it crap. It's a perfunctory product with some style brought in at a price. I rate the sound quality at 3.0, the value at 3.5 stars. Music will fill your roomspace at a moderate to decent volume and it will have semblance of bass. Expect perfunctory but presentable midrange and highs. Like I said placement can improve the high dispersion. You could use this as a quick background speaker for an impromptu party - I just wish the highs and midrange output were a bit more...artsy? (That's my audiophile craving speaking. I own Celestion and ELAC speakers at home.) At $24.99 you probably can't go wrong for what you are getting here. It can always be a second "in a pinch" system.UPGRADE SUGGESTION:From the reviews I have read, if you have more like $80 to spend, and want something at the next level, consider the JBL "Flip 3" or "Flip 4" speakers.
