-Set up. (Dislike) I had to find a manual online because the one 'quick guide' that came with the head phones was inadequate to say the least. The 'quick guide' doesn't tell you how long the headset needs to charge before use, nor how to connect it to your computer. It doesn't inform you of the ways you can charge the headset either.-Fitting. (Kind of Dislike) The ear pads sit atop your ears, so people with bigger ears might not like them. I prefer a set that go around the ear. After wearing for only 15 minutes my ears feel hot, and squished.-Sound. (Like) My office is in the front room of my house so that my puppy can be near by and not feel excluded, when there is constant sound in my headphone I can't hear her chewing 5 feet away.
