Workes great if you plug into computer so you can move ring light where needed. Only down fall if plugging into wall is the cord length. Be sure to lock stand or it will slide. Unfortunately due to phone weight and stand falling it only lasted me a month. So be careful and aware of the balance of phone and how your ring light is plugged in. Over all it is great and light is adjustable in height and brightness.
