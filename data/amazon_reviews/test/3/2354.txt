I specifically shopped for one with a short cord and flat plug. This one has a photo showing it does have that flat plug, but it actually does not have the flat plug.It works fine for the intended purpose, and it's not worth the hassle of returning it, but I'm extremely disappointed that the plug is not as pictured because it's exactly what I did NOT want.For receiving something other than what's pictured, which is totally unacceptable even if it does otherwise work, I deducted two stars.
