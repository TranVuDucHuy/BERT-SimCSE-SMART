I bought this for the long holiday travel while doing some remote works. I kinda thought that with this, I wouldn't need to pack a bunch of power bricks with me for all the devices, but you still kinda do. It works great, but the more devices you plug-in, the slower (or even out-right insufficient) the charging becomes. So you ended up could only plug in one or MAYBE two devices (depends on what device) at a time which I thought was kinda defeat the purpose. For me it's the combinations of iPhone, iPad Pro, MBP, EarPods Max, and Steamdeck configurations.So yeah, as far as I'm concerned, it won't just replace all your power bricks, so I'd still bring a few with you just in-case.
