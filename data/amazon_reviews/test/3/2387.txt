UPDATE: 12/20/22 now I’ve lost one earbud and the other will not pair with my phone. 😠😞My favorite earbuds prior to getting these soundcore life P3 earbuds were the Skullcandy Indy Evo buds so I find myself comparing these buds to those.I use earbuds primarily to listen to audiobooks and to block out sounds in my environment and these do that well. I have no ear for music nor do I listen to it often so I can’t speak to the quality of these earbuds in that regard.My ears are finicky when it comes to earbud fit and these are my favorite of the 10 or 20 types that I’ve tried. They don’t fall out and they don’t make my ears hurt.My favorite thing so far about these buds is the battery life. So far they outperform all the others I’ve tried in that regard.I’ve had no trouble connecting these buds to my phone, computer, tablet and television and they perform well with all these devices for me….in this regard they are far superior to the Indy Evo buds.Things I’m not impressed with so far. 1) It’s far to easy to touch them and activate a command when….putting them on, taking them off, brushing my hair back, laying my head on a pillow, exercising, brushing against someone/something when in close contact, etc. I would definitely prefer controls to not be touch controls.2) I’m forever losing my earbuds 😏 and depend heavily on a finder app to keep up with them (love the skullcandy ones that use the tile app) but apparently the finder function on these only works if you’re phone is currently connected via Bluetooth to them 😞😞😞 and so the tone won’t sound if a) they’ve turned off because you haven’t connected with them in the past 30minutes, b) the battery is dead….current situation with my left earbud, c) they are in the case (of course for me the case with or without the buds in it is often what I’ve lost), etc 😞. The tile app function with the Indy Evo buds saved me so many times in similar circumstances.3) they sometimes don’t lay in the case properly and therefore don’t chargeOverall I like these buds but I’m quite sure I’ll misplace the remaining earbud soon and the finder app won’t be helpful and therefore will need to buy another set soon.4) I was initially impressed with the app and all the info it provided until I realized I basically couldn’t use the app unless I was connected via Bluetooth to the buds which is impossible if I’ve lost them (and therefore can’t use the app to find them😞).
