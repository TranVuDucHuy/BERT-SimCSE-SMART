This is my second time ordering this. The first two work well. This time, I ordered to keep one in my weekend bag and one at work. I went on a long weekend and only had the new one in my travel weekend bag. It turns out it doesn't work. I checked that there was no dust or dirt, I made sure the connections were snug enough to actually connect. Nothing. So my phone was dead the entire weekend as I was the only person with a Type C cord. I contacted the company if I can exchange the defective one right away (1st week of Sept) and never head back by the time of this review....
