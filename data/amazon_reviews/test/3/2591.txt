Not sure how long it will last. Sound in my kid's kindle was good. I brought it for my kids, but will pay more attention to how it lasts. the wire was thick so I don't see it tearing so easily, but does not fit the walkie talkies I got which just may be the walkie talkie product defect. Other than that, this is a good buy. Suggest anyone to buy****UPDATE****So not a good buy. They didnâ€™t last a year of use when they stopped working.
