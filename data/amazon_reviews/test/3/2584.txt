These were great for my 7th-grade ELA students for the first 2 months. They are comfortable for the students, they are easy to clean with a wipe, and the sound is good. However, after a couple of months, one stopped working. Now, after 6 months of using them once or twice a week, I have only 1 set left that works. There is no visible damage to the outside, they just won't work.
