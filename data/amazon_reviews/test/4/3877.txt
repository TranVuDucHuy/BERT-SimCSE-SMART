I've had this mount for 5 months now, and I gotta say, I'm impressed by its resilience. All the images I included I made myself with the mount, and any weird colors or poor detail are a result of my light pollution or telescope, NOT the mount.This mount works very well for the price. My setup now involves guiding, and I think that's the limit of what I can do with this mount and its weight limit considering the low price.PROS-This mount is quite cheap for the photos you can make with it-It's rather easy and intuitive to set up-Its small size makes it the perfect travel mountCONS-This mount doesn't have declination control (this is only an issue when you start guiding but it's annoying)-The low weight limit (11 pounds) means that you can't put any more weight on it than a camera + telescope + guide camera/scope-The mount not being go-to means you have to find objects manually, which can be very annoying sometimesOverall, I recommend this mount. However, if your budget allows for it, I'd definitely go for something heftier like an EQM-35, which is one of the best mounts at its price point, with a huge payload capacity and go-to capabilities.Miscellaneous notes/tips:-You need to get a sturdy tripod for this thing (at least $60)-You should get a mini-USB to power the mount instead of batteries, since this thing kind of eats through AA batteries- If you want really good nebula photos and don't care about normal photography, look into modifying your DSLR, all of the nebula pictures here only look that good because I modified my camera-You either need an intervalometer on your camera or an external one to take minute+ long exposures-If you get really into astrophotography with this thing (like I did), I'd do some research on good telescopes, filters, mounts, guiding, and anything that will make your images better. (I ripped the back out of my camera and installed a PC fan to get better photos)-2 items I would recommend right off the bat is the Rokinon 135mm camera lens, and the SVBONY sv503 400mm telescope. Both of these items are worth so much more than their seemingly steep price.
