Reolink RLC-842A, I wanted to love this camera but ...... it just did not fit in with the rest of my current camera setup. I wanted the 4K with 25 fps but with H.265 compression it just did not work for me. Note: I did not test this with an NVR or Synology NAS.Pros:4K video resolution at the faster 25 fpsbuilt-in microphone and audio supportPoE connectionzoom with auto focusCons:nonstandard square mounting hole arrangement (although the base is round the mounting is square)nonhidden IR LEDlack of camera web interface controls (the web interface settings were noticeably just lacking it this area and the main reason I sent it back.)No ONVIFNo H.264 support
