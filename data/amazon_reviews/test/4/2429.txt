I bought this projector as a cheaper alternative to buying a tv for my room and it’s honestly been great. The only thing that sucks is the fan noise it makes in the background; the audio is a lot better than I expected. Idk how some ppl are able to project it as a larger image and still keep the image quality, I noticed that the farther the projector is from the screen the worse the quality. I also don’t like how the hdmi cables aren’t compatible with iPhones or Macbooks. I have to use the Chromestick in place of the hdmi and connect it to my Macbook.
