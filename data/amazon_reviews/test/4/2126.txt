I bought this pair of headphones as a backup for my wireless headphones, thinking I might need them if I was listening to music for an extended period of time.As it turns out, wireless headphones last a long time, 4 or 5 hours, and I do not typically listen to music for longer than that in a stretch. I would say I prefer the sound of my $40 wireless headphones a slight bit over these, but it's really slight.I can attest to the fact that the cords are basically tangle free. Only complaint would be that there's a tendency for the rubber ear-parts to come off, though they included replacements, and as it happens I have not lost any of them yet.They're decent sounding for the price but as I say, I barely use them, and probably should have just gotten a backup set of wireless headphones vs. thinking I needed wired ones.
