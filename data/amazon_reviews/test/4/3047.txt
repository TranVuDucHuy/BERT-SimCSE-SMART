This is a great (and probably best) option for modern instant cameras. Aside from the Now+ which offers some more features there's not much to improve on.You can't beat the original though, if you're old enough to have used an actual Polaroid its not exactly the same.If you are just looking for something to point and shoot and get some nice pictures this is exactly what you want.Pictures run DARK so I would recommend testing out the flash, exposure and lighting settings with one or two pictures before taking it out for a real session.If you want to have the photos digitally or add effects to it or do anything other than point shoot and have pictures get the Now+.If you just want a get up and go instant camera this is it!Black and White is a nice color but spring for the color you like most as the colors are pretty dynamic!
