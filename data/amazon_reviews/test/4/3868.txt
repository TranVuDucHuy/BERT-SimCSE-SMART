This is a great value and perfectly adequate camera for casual use. At $30, it packs a lot of useful features.Setup: Really easy. Camera can be set upright on any surface, or mounted to a wall. There is a tiny template for drilling/attaching/installing the small mounting piece. The camera is entirely controlled via the NetVue app. You need to create a NetVue account -- you can login w/Google or FB, or create a NetVue login. Following the included instructions, connection to Wifi was a snap. The app finds the camera, prompts the wifi/setup info, and you're instantly monitoring. You must be connected to the same wifi network.Controls: Very easy. The app includes a virtual 'pad' to rotate the camera side to side, and horizon to horizon. You can view in portrait or landscape mode. You can only rotate on one axis at a time, but you can get an entire 360 view around the camera. The middle button of the virtual pad will take a snapshot of the scene and save to the app. There may be some lag depending on your connection. In a good spot around my home, the camera is very responsive -- there is always going to be a *slight* delay since you are controlling and monitoring via your wifi network, but it's negligible if you're just focusing on one general area. By contrast, in a weaker part of my home, there is a significant delay, and some choppiness to the feed -- this is not an issue with the camera nor the app, as my phone loses and reconnects frequently in this area. Please keep that in mind if you're experiencing significant lag/choppiness. There is also a built-in speaker in the camera which you can speak through via the app.Quality: I want to stress that for $30, you should not expect super high resolution and smooth motion like you're watching a professional live television feed. You get a good, clear picture, real-time motion monitoring, and good screen captures. You can change between Standard Definition (SD) and High Definition (HD) modes, though the HD may be limited by your wifi speed/connection. Same goes for audio clarity through the speaker. WIth a good connection, you can hear what was said clearly.App: The app includes a *lot* of features and functionality. You can add an SD card to the camera to save recordings and replay via the app. There is also an option to use NetVue's cloud storage, which requires purchasing one of their cloud storage plans. There are links to a helpful forum, an FAQ, and contact information for support. There is Alexa integration. You can share device feed/controls with another NetVue user, set up a sleep mode schedule, and toggle night vision on/off.Night Vision & Motion Detection: Night Vision works very well. I tried in a dark room with some ambient lighting coming from another room, and the camera still broadcast a very clear b/w picture. It will switch automatically when it detects very low light. Motion Detection works great. The app will take a short video/screenshot of any motion it detects and then send a notice to your phone. Make sure you allow "Notifications" in the app itself (iPhone) in order to receive Motion alerts. You can limit to people, pets, vehicles, and many other choices, or simply detect "all" motions.Overall: Great little device for the price. Would work perfect as an indoor security cam, a baby monitor, a pet monitor, etc. I personally bought it to watch and get alerts on when the squirrels that live outside our place come by for a visit -- but, I would not recommend mounting and leaving this outdoors. It is not weather proof, and it is not meant for outdoor wear & tear. But, if you have a safe spot where you can mount and leave it, it will function just fine. The rotational motion is ideal for what we need, give the squirrels tend to walk right up to our door, or wait out on the ledge out front.
