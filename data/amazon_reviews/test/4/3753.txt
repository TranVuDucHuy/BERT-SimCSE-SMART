When I first opened this and inserted the batteries, the film cover would not eject and the LED light on the front flashed rapidly.The directions are kind of a joke. Mostly pictures with little additional explanation.The troubleshooting section just said that a rapidly flashing LED was an indication of an "error".I tried a fresh set of batteries and the camera did finally eject the film cover.I may revisit this review once I have taken some photos with it.So far I am not super impressed, but will give it 4 stars for now.
