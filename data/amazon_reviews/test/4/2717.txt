I figured everything else out on the ear buds. They have great sound quality. Easy to connect. Battery life is lasting. But the noise cancellation is the hardest to figure out. Its not like it comes with an app to reduce the cancellation or adjust it. But ive made phone calls and i get “whats that noise in the background” every time.
