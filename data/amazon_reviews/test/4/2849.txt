The buds work fine. They integrate well with the Galaxy 22 Ultra which is set up already for them. What I don't like is the battery life lasts for less than 90 minutes and then they need recharging. I wish I could plug in earphones to the phone but for obvious reasons (selling us earbuds), the new phones don't seem to include the option to plug in earphones.
