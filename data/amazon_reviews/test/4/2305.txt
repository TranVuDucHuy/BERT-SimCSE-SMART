Headphones were almost like new. The only minor issue was the leather ear cups seemed a bit too squishy and flat. It was not a big deal, though. The battery life is not as good as my old Sony XB900Ns but still decent. Noise cancellation and sound quality is much better than those, though. Great deal if you can get them for $250 like I did.
