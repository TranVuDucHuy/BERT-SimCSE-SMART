These are a good basic choice for protecting the case of my AirPods Pro.The case comes with a decent carbiner and small key ring to make attaching them to my bag much easier. The case fits well to my AirPods and sticks well through friction but the lack of extra adhesive tape inside makes me question how long that will last. Due to where I work I wanted to make sure I saw the AirPods case in the event I dropped it, as such I purchased the high visibility orange color. It is definitely bright enough. The orange color is very vibrant and bright and can easily be seen from a good distance away, perfect for my needs.The one downside to this case however is the potential of it sliding off. The case I had for my old pair of AirPods shipped with two small strips of double sided tape which helped the case to stick for much longer - while this case stays on just fine now (and for the ~2 months I've used it) after a year I doubt it will hold as well ass it may bend or stretch with time - but I will update this review if proven wrong.Overall this is a good choice for basic protection for your AirPods, the silicone feels very well made and the colors are very vibrant. All-in-all a great product for the price.
