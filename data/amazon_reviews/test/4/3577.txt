This is a good all around multi-function outlet, that provides 5 primary outlets, 3 USB, and 1 USB-C. It also has a nice built-in night light. I installed mine at our coffee bar countertop, where we have a lot of chargers for our daily devices (phones, watches, etc.). Good value at the sale price of $17, but may not have bought at list price of $27. My only negative is it's a little over-engineered for stability, with a single-prong plastic support (that plugs into one of the outlets), as well as screw to mount to outlet. It did not fit well with my current outlet, so I cut the single-prong plastic support off, and simply threw away the mounting screw. You really don't need this unless you are constantly plugging and unplugging cords into the outlet. The way mine is setup, I very rarely unplug anything.
