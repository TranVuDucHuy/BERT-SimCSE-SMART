I really wanted to get away from my normal action camera brand and I have purchased several DJI drones so I was thinking this was a good fit for me. The battery is awesome the audio even in wind was very good, but it has a soft focus or actually out of focus lens. This is a fixed lens camera so unless DJI can take the camera back to the factory and adjust the lens to put it in focus, absolutely no software is going to fix this issue.
