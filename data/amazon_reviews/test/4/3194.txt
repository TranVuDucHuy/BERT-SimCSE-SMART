I have a love hate relationship with lenses. Most of the ones I have bought are great for daytime use. But since I do astrophotography and my lenses are always dual use, most of the lenses I have bought are not great for Astro.I have been trying Rokinon 16 and 14 mm lenses for wide angle work, and while ok for astro, they're cumbersome to use in daytime since they're fully manual lenses. So I bought this one. Excellent depth of field even at 18 mm due to the fast f ratio. Very sharp in daytime. Night time, it does show aberrations towards the corners even on an aps-c sensor. Also has some serious vignetting at all focal lengths. So this is why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.
