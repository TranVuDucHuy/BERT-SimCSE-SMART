I bought this product for an Album Cover party. While the instructions to set up were very helpful. The main complaint I had was the number of wrinkles my product came with. I spent 20 minutes trying to get them out via a steamer, but I had little to no success in the endeavor. Outside of this, the product has worked as intended and I don't regret the purchase at all.
