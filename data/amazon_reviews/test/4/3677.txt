The bad, buyer alert - all the complaints about not being able to group Sonos speakers with Alexa speakers and Echo are true. Despite Sonos' carefully crafted language to the contrary.The good - speaker is great for all the reasons that you've seen and there is an easy work around for Alexa groups.The problem - you'll see a lot of reviews that complain because you cannot put Sonos speakers and Alexa Echo Dot devices/speakers into groups. If you are a fan of Alexa groups as I am and use it to play throughout your house, that's a major fail and that's what most reviewers say. And I agree with them that this is a terrible oversight and needs to be corrected by Sonos or Amazon. I didn't see those reviews until after I bought. happy ending ahead.The workaround - what you can do is attach a Sonos speaker as you would any Bluetooth speaker to an Echo Dot. Then you can add that pairing to a group just as you would any Alexa device.My application, patio - I wanted outdoor speakers from the patio that were connected to my Alexa group inside the house so I had seamless music as people moved in and out. That's why I was disappointed when I could not connect the Sonos Move to my group aptly named party time.Connecting the Sonos Move to the Echo was super easy and solved my issue. I had an extra echo device to use, but even if you have to buy one it's only 30 bucks. The echo device does not also play music though, it only comes out through the slaved speaker.Great thing for me was portability of the Move speaker and its outdoor capabilities. I could not find any Echo devices that were rated for outdoor. So this solved that problem. The Echo stays inside and the Move is ready to take outside and don't have to worry if I forget to bring it in.Big sound filled my 3500 sf patio and pool with one speaker. though admittedly I am polite to neighbors.Before this, I had an excellent Sony GTX speaker that was connected to a Echo device and that worked fine, but it was a nuisance because the Sony had to be plugged in and the Sony speaker was huge and I had to bring it inside because it wasn't an outdoor speaker.I also had the option of doing wired speakers but I thought that was more expensive to install and elected not to do. Also considered solar powered speakers but they all seem to be weaker speakers so ruled that out. Connecticut reviewerSent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphoneGet Outlook for Android
