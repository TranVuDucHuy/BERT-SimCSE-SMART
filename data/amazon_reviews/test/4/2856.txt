So I got my new Plantronics earbud a couple days ago. Was very very excited. I've had a couple before and really liked them. My only issue with the earlier ones I used was they were easy to lose! Cuz they're nice, small - you throw them in your car, backpack - whatever - and later I found one chewed by my dog. Believe it or not I used it for several weeks then bought a new one. This one I decided to upgrade. I went for a more expense model -- all the reviews said the sound quality was excellent, noise cancelling great etc etc. It arrived -- I came home after a 12-plus shift -- and this is what was in the box with it: a large piece of paper, with "safety warnings", "charging warnings" and one other subject, ??user warnings? -- large piece of paper cuz was repeated in at least 12 or 15 languages. Fine. I get it - we're a global community. Another small folded paper was warranty info. Another was something about I think FCC compliance. NO OWNERS MANUAL. Absolutely no instructions on how to synch, how to charge - it comes with this really cool charging case. I am assuming, because I have yet to google and download an owner's manual you can keep the earbud in the charging case while your not using it -- and it will recharge. No idea how often the charging case has to be recharged...cuz yet to download the manual. BUT the biggest pain for me was just figuring out how to synch it and use it! I sat in my car today, googled plantronics 5200 earbud - how to synch with my iPhone...and got an answer. I have paid over $100 for this earbud -- why do I have to google to learn how to use it???? So I figured out how to synch and then my iPHONE, not plantronics, told me I needed to download an app to use the "devise." As I am sure you can tell, all of the above really really bugged me. Come on, Plantronics! We are giving you a chunk on change -- and you can't even give us an owner's manual????? Oh yea -- there was this other piece of thin cardboard insert, picturing the earbud, with arrows telling you volume controls, button to push to answer call, etc. But even that was very very minimal. I am kinda sorta fairly computer literate -- and I had to google how to synch, etc.Ok -- I've vented. Now -- about the earbud. It's really great. (If you can figure out how to use it). I called my sister on way home from work today and asked her how it compared to my "other"' earbud. She said, "OMG this is sooo much better!!! Your other one had this irritating clicking, background noise...drove me nuts...". (The other one was the earbud that came with my iPhone...the necklace you wear around your neck with earbuds hanging from their soft plastic lines, moorings, with magnetic plates so you can anchor them in the necklace - nice thought Apple. I love you but you missed it on this one...). Right now I am sitting here listening to my music via the Plantronics earbud...and I really gotta say the quality is great. Love it. Little mabbeso other note -- I decided to try one step smaller on the earbuds included, thinking it would nestle deeper in my ear canal and better sound transmission. Thought the smaller one was better until I tried the bigger one...now am thinking go bigger. Is easier to get a good seal -- hence better sound transmission without background dilution. But I suspect it's an individual preference.All in all this is a great Bluetooth earbud. If you don't mind not getting any instructions on how to use it when you get it. Easy to use and great quality. I would have rated it a 5 outta 5 if they hadn't pissed me off so bad with the no manual......
