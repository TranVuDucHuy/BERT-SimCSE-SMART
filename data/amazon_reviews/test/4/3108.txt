These perform like your usual microfiber cloths, but the shear size makes it much easier to use. To clean glass, it’s better to use 2 of them- one to wipe off the spray and another dry cloth to wipe off the streaks. Similar story with eyeglasses. Isn’t possible with the usual tiny microfiber cloths as I find myself with the cloth saturated with cleaner and unable dry clean the smudges.
