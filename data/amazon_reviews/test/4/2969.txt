The mint color is nice, the buds look great sitting around the house. There was only one extra set of covers in the package but for the price I can't complain. The 3.5 mm jack fits tightly in my Galaxy S9+ unlike many higher end earbuds and phones. I don't know if the sound is good but at least there aren't any issues. I use the smallest covers so the noise cancelling isn't great but that's how I like it. People say the microphone sounds good on calls.
