I received this product in perfect condition very quickly. I'm happy with it. I have only 1 complaint and several compliments.My only complaint is, I purchased this projector on Amazon for $597. The next day it was one hundred dollars cheaper on Amazon. I wanted to cancel the order and reorder it to recover the $100. But I didn't do that because it would be unethical.Compliments:1. Compatibility. I own a galaxy note 8+, 10+, 20 ultra and 22 ultra. The projector is compatible with all my Samsung phones and tablets.2. Smart TV. I have Amazon PRIME, Apple movies and TV shows, YouTube premium, and more for streaming services. Additionally the Samsung channel is a bonus. The App works flawlessly. The smart TV functionality built into the projector is a good idea...3. Connectivity. The 5.2 Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Samsung Dex works well.4. Functionality. The 180 degrees pivot is adequate. The 360 degrees speakers are adequate as well. The keystone projection is ok. The 1080p resolution is good. The hdmi port works well. The brightness is good in a dark room.5. Software Updates. Since January 2022 several software updates have fixed some issues that are reported on in the YouTube reviews. Unfortunately the reviewers did not provide subsequent reviews to correct theirs misgivings.
