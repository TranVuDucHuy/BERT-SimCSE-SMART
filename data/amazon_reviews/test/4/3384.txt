UPDATE: the sound cut outs and disconnects were from my phone. It needed to be updated and it began doing the same thing with my old headphones, my car, and my Bluetooth speaker at home. Performed a restart and an update and everything’s working better now! So that was on me, not the headphones. My other complaints do stand, but the primary issue was the sound cut outs, and now that I know it’s not these headphones I like them much more! Still maybe not worth the $60 price tag, but they’re pretty good honestly. Also, I’m 1 month into using them 2-3 times a week for 2 hours per use, and I still haven’t needed to charge them, so the charge is admirably awesome!ORIGINAL:These aren’t the WORST headphones you could wear. But they’re far from the best, especially for the price.I had a pair of Anker Bluetooth sport headphones I bought from Walmart in 2017 for $50 and those things were dynamite. They looked a little dorky I guess with the cord connecting them around the back of my head, but they were troopers. They’re still going strong after 6 years now, except for battery life (which I expected to just go out like years ago).Bottom line, I really trusted this company from these headphones quality.That trust has been broken.Glitchy controls, terrible pairing, and already worse sound quality to name a few.Controls - there is 1 control on both ear. I don’t think they can be changed, which is fine. Right is 1 click sound up, 2 clicks pause/play. Left is 1 click sound down, 2 clicks skip track. Simple enough. However, the buttons don’t always react, and when they do there’s a delay. Meaning the music doesn’t ratchet up or down when you want it to, so I go “oh it didn’t register the button, let me hit it again” and then boom - track skipped, or song paused. Annoying.Pairing - this is simply bad. I don’t know if the buds are always seeking or what. But they disconnect from my phone about 3 times per gym session. And it’s not always both buds - sometimes it’s just 1. Or it’ll cut in and out of connection during an entire song. There is no way to turn off the buds or reset the pairing without the case, which I do not carry in the gym; I leave it in my bag. And for a pair of earbuds, the case is relatively clunky and large, and it won’t stay in my pockets in gym shorts. This is just a complete defect of the product in my opinion.Sound quality - I’ve had these for 2 weeks and they’re already quieter than my 2017 pair…. Come on man. I’m consistently getting warnings from my iPhone that my volume is dangerously loud because I’m basically at 80% on average for most of the session just to actually have the music sound good. For comparison, I’ve had 2nd gen AirPods since 2019 and I keep them on about 55-60% most of the time, usually with general quieter music than workout music. Sure I’m not in a noisy gym most of the time, but still.Two good things to say - battery life is fine, you can get about 5-6 uses out of them before you need to recharge the case. Also it’s nice it comes with multiple sets of buds, but they can be a liability as they pop off VERY easily and I almost lost one today in the locker room just trying to wipe them on my tshirt.All in all, for $60 I wasted my money. Overall very disappointed in these. My call is save your money for another month or so and grab some earbuds from Beats or JLab when they’re on sale. These are a fine backup pair, but I’m not even a month in and I’m already on the look for new headphones.
