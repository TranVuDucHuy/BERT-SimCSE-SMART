I like how I can write comfortably with the S pen fold edition, like using a regular pen. However I find at times that I need to press harder than usual when writing in order to get better accuracy. I wish I didn't have to press hard at times, and what I write sometimes doesn't always get converted accurately when using the handwriting conversion feature. Overall, it's nifty, comfortable and cool to have and use.
