Celestron travel scope is a good product for what it is made for. It is primarily a terrestrial viewing scope. The objective (large lens in front of the scope) is good quality and is functional. However, the eyepieces that come with the scope are (in my opinion) lower quality (this is probably done to keep the total cost of the scope low). Without a decent eyepiece the experience of viewing objects will be minimal.What I did was invest about $25.00 (they can be higher priced - based on quality) in a good quality 20mm x1.25 inch (a good standard starting size) "Plossel" type eyepiece (several listed on Amazon for under $30.00). The addition of a higher quality eyepiece really changed the viewing experience with this scope. Or, if you want to get into astronomical viewing with this scope Celestron makes an Observers Accessory Kit (#94308- you can get it on Amazon - about $70.00). It comes with two Plossel eyepieces -17mm and 6mm-, a moon filter (definitely will need it to bring down the glare if observing the moon), a 2X Barlow lens (doubles the magnification of the eyepieces), and two planetary filters, and a case. It seems like a well put together and thought out accessory kit (I know, another $70.00 !!).Also (as stated in other reviews) the tripod is weak (when extended to its full length). What I recommend is getting a sturdy table (and chair) and set the tripod (in its non-extended or shortest length) on the table. Sit in the chair, and rotate the 45 degree prism (with eyepiece attached) until you can see what you want. You don't need to be standing to view the stars (or whatever)!! It is even better to get a 90 degree correct image diagonal to view the heavens with (that way you don't have to bend over so far, and you can aim the scope higher - I know even more money - actually about $45.00 for a starter correct image diagonal). Become familiar with how the pieces attach (eyepiece to 45 degree prism to insertion in the telescopes focusing tube-and how they can be rotated to your seated position) and you will get a lot more enjoyment out of this well made product.Remember, this is not a heavy duty alt-azimuth tripod with slow motion controls (Celestron #93607 - which looks like it would fit this scopes screw on base). It is basically a standard camera tripod. You will have to "play" with it and figure out (especially on celestial objects) how to aim it high and then tighten the adjustments (which will lower the object into your field of view). You could even buy a heavier tripod with the same type of adjustments that this tripod has - Celestron #93610- it would make the scope more secure if you needed to fully extend the legs on the tripod - I have one that I use with some of my other telescopes - you just have to get used to the way it adjusts -think each mentioned tripod is about $80.00 to $90.00 (that money just keeps adding up !!). The adjustment for lowering the object into view while tightening the tripod controls takes some getting used to, but it can be learned -and is part of the overall "experience" of this fine travel scope.Also, about the adjustments on the tripod. The vertical (up and down) lever on the tripod - do not back it out all the way. What happened to me is that a small nut that attaches the handle to the tripod will fall out. So what I did was put a piece of tape over the hole where the nut is - so if I backed out the adjustment to far, the nut would not fall out (no big deal - just need to be aware that it could happen).I have had this scope for several years, and have seen many celestial objects with it (although I use a correct image 90 degree star diagonal - as stated previously). It is a nice scope for its intended purpose, however (in my opinion) it does need a couple of upgrades (as suggested).Further, if you need to make the tripod more secure when it is on a table top or partially extended - try draping some "strap on ankle weights" over one or more of the tripod's braces (let one or both sides of the weight rest on the table - so you don't over stress the brace). I had some old strap on ankle weights lying around, just draped one over the brace (without strapping it down), and it makes it much more secure. Also, you get two ankle braces in a set. So you will have an extra one if you need it !!So let's review. The most important item on any telescope is the objective lens (as stated previously) the large lens in the front of the scope. The Celestron Travel scope objective lens is of good quality, that's where I think the product excels. I recommend to buy a higher quality eyepiece (Plossel type), add some weight to the tripod (as suggested)-do not extend the tripod into its fully extended position (becomes really shaky and weak)-keep it as "low as possible"-preferably on a table top (add an "ankle weight" to the fold out extensions), learn how to rotate the 45 degree diagonal so you can view while seated (this won't change the correct image view of the object), and you have a very well made, fairly light weight travel scope. I have used this scope for terrestrial and astronomical purposes, and as a "spotting scope" while at the range. Works perfectly !! I hope this review has assisted you in your decision (I know -I didn't intend for this review to be so long - but there you have it !!). Have fun !!
