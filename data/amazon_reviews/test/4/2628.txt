I love having my greenscreen for my Twitch streams (twitch.tv/claravitalia) but it was kind of a pain to set up. I chock this up to my already-strange PC setup and not product quality.I will say that the clamps that came with this item were kinda shoddy. Very clearly 3D printed with pretty low resolution, and the rubbery pads on the contact points come off constantly, sometimes going flying when they do. I don't use the clamps for the greenscreen, but I think it's prudent that people know about their quality for if they do.Overall quite happy with this purchase. Nice price, and provides a seamless effect for my purposes!
