I have these cameras for some time and they are working good. The app could be better. The basic functionality is there but there are problems with the motion detection. The camera will alert to moving tree branches of flowers when it’s windy or it will alert then there are light reflections from cars that are passing by. The function where you can blank out certain areas to avoid falls alters is not working as it should. There are better apps on the market that will do a much better job in differentiating a moving person from a moving tree branch.Considering the low cost I would say this is a good product. Don’t forget to order an sd card so you can actually record the video. Without sd card the cam is very much useless unless you only want to watch in real-time.
