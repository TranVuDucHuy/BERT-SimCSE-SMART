Long story short, I've used devices like these for year now, and this one met my expectation. However, when using outdoors to listen to music while doing yard work... sweat can get in there and cause problem. I thought it was broken, as it got caught in a loop and would continuously mute itself... rendering it useless. I tried hard and soft reboots. Nothing work.What finally got it back into working condition was to let the battery drain to zero, and start over. Then it started working again. Lesson learned: Keep it in the office, and keep it dry.
