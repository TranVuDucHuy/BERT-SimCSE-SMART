TL;DR - I would say that the TOZO A2 is pretty much unbeatable in its price bracket. I don't believe there are any negatives that would discourage me from recommending this product to anyone, but there are definitely some quirks that I hope to see TOZO improve on in the future. As someone who has owned a previous generation of TOZO product, I do appreciate how they seem to actively listen to feedback. They also have had wonderful support, in my experience.Sound: The tuning is bass-heavy but they manage to not sound too muddled. I was surprised that battery powered earbuds could thump and rumble as well as these do. If you're looking for something a little more detailed and treble-focused, these probably aren't for you without some EQ work. Songs can feel a little "in your face" at times because the soundstage on these is relatively narrow. The plus side is what it lacks in space it makes up for in directionality. I was impressed with how clearly I could hear the positioning of instruments. In this regard, the A2 outclasses many much more expensive earbuds and IEMs that I've tried. I was hoping that TOZO offered a partner app that would allow for personal tuning, but I do not believe there is one available at the moment. The only objective negative I can point out in the sound department is that, despite being bass-focused, the max volume is still on the low side. If you like to listen to music louder than average you may be disappointed.Construction: These don't feel like $20 earbuds at all. The injection molding on the plastic components is all very clean and the case feels solid. The hinge has no play in it and the cover closes with a satisfying magnetic snap. There is a single USB-C port on the exterior for charging the integrated case battery. Charging status is indicated by LED lights on the front of the case as well as on each of the earbuds.Fit: I personally found these to be very comfortable and light. I forgot I was wearing them many times. The shape seems to ensure that they are more "one size fits all" than more traditional earbuds. My only nitpick is that there is no cutout or groove to keep the silicone tips aligned to the oval stem so sometimes I noticed I'd need to rotate the tips so they aligned with the speaker hole again.Features: The range on these things has been excellent. I'll sometimes leave my phone and wander around the house while working on chores and I've had zero disconnects so far. They resume connection very quickly on my Pixel 6 when being removed from the charging case. I've not yet had a single time where I ran down the battery in one listening session save for the time when I tried them right out of the box and they weren't fully charged. If you do ever reach low battery you'll definitely know it though. The annoyed voice notification will repeat over and over about once per minute until you charge them again. Speaking of charging, I was a bit surprised to find that they didn't support wireless charging on the case but I really can't even complain for the price. My only true frustration? The touch controls. I loved this feature on my previous TOZO model but I cannot stand it on these. Yes, it's functional. If you input the command it proceeds to carry it out. However, it's become quite a nightmare to input the intended commands. The area that registers touches is much smaller on these earbuds due to their shape. I had assumed that the stems would be touch sensitive all the way down but that does not seem to be the case. There's only a tiny section near the LED indicator light on the earbud that works for these commands. Good luck hitting it consistently. Maybe I'm just not practiced enough yet but tapping twice to go to the next song or previous one is so unreliable. I end up in a cycle of pausing and resuming my music about 5 times before I actually get it to work. Of course, I don't want that to come off as too negative. The earbuds are still wonderful for their main purposes of listening to and enjoying music. Just something to consider if you intend to use them further away from your device.
