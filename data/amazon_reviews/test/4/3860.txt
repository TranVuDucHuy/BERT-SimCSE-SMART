I have been comparing these side by side with the Leupold BX-1 10x42 binoculars. These are definitely not 20x50. The images through the two binoculars are identical so I would say they are more like 10x42. That being said, the Leupolds cost 4x as much which is reflected in the build quality of the Leupolds.If you are just looking for binoculars with a great 10x42 ish image and don't mind them being somewhat large (although still lightweight), these are a pretty good set.
