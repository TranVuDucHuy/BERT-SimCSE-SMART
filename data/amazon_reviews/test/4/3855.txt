Update 11/21/2022:The customer service at this company is great! They reached out to me directly asking if they could send me a new light after I had some issues with my previous one. Since the first one I had did make a significant difference in how my Zoom calls went, I know I'm going to be happy having another one again. Especially as we move into the darker winter months! I really appreciated the customer service.-- Original Review: --I loved this ring light -- it's a great brightness, really helped my Zoom calls, and was all together perfect for what I needed. Sure it had some minor issues, like I could not for the life of me extend the pole higher (the metal locking knob just straight-up did not work, and refused to ever tighten around the pole, so I could not extend it). But otherwise I was pretty happy with it, and it made my work videos much better. But then the big problem was that the ring light just 100% stopped working one day. That was about 5 months after I bought it, so outside of the return window. I'm pretty unhappy about that, both because it means it was a waste of my money, and also because environmentally, I do not like the idea of just trashing plastic/electronic items a few months after buying them. It's so wasteful and bad for the earth. I wish there was a way to fix this thing and make it work again, but it seems just fully busted. I'm pretty sad about that.
