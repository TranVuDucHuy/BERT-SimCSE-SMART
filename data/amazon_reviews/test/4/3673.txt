I really enjoy not having to find the charging port and the wear plugging in a charger causes. I keep a cord in my car to charge while driving and, with the cold here in Wisconsin, the magnet doesn't like to stay attached. Makes me a little sad since I never know if my phone is getting a full charge until I stop.
