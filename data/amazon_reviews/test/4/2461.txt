* Used as a live camera for Zoom.I did not use the 'To PC' function, as I have a USB video card (for HDMI to USB-A, to plug into laptop. I used an 'HDMI mini' to 'HDMI' cable (both male) to connect )* Digital zoom is 'adequate'. Would be nice to have optical zoom. Being fully zoomed out causes some pixelation & lower quality image, as can be expected.Note: To use the digital zoom feature, you'd need to change the mode from 'video' to 'camera' since digital zooming only works with 'camera' mode* A small battery bank is helpful as additional power boost, although I used the camera for just over an hour with the included battery with no trouble... Not sure of the total available battery life. If you've mounted on a tripod, you'll need to take the camera off the stand to change the battery, which is located on the underside.
