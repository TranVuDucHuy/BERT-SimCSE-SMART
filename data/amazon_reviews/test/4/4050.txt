I record audio and collect synthesizers as a hobby. I wanted to get a microphone that was better than the stock one that comes in my Sony A6400. This one works very well and I'm very happy with it. I had some videos I wanted to shoot of myself and someone else (different video) sitting about 15 feet away. Picked up the audio well and did reduce the wind noise. Now this isn't the best mic ever, the condenser mic I use when recoding vocals or instruments is lightyears better but it's closer to $800 and is coupled with $1000 compressor and a $400ish tube preamp. Still, very happy with this purchase.
