One of the best handheld gimbals available! This is not a perfect product, but it is a well made, high quality, small, stabilizing 4k video platform that shoots wide enough angle, zooms, has good battery life, & will probably suit your needs if you are looking for something like it.It is a great product.One major drawback, especially if you are not familiar with editing software and plan to use this in multi camera edits, it records multiple files for each recording! If you record a 30 minute video you will get five or six individual video clips . This may or may not be a big deal, but it is definitely an annoyance at best and something I wish I had known before diving into the platform.You Must use the companion app to set up, And the display screen is so small and touch screen controls are so difficult, that you likely will want to use your phone or other mobile device for controls and viewfinder . Fortunately, the companion app really is quite nice and works very well and it is quite easy to clamp your phone onto some type of accessory that holds the camera and phone such that it’s not too big of an inconvenience. For quick impromptu shooting, it’s kind of a pain to always have to turn on your phone and connect to the camera and so you will end up using the onboard controls and screen at least some of the time and they are annoying at best to use, but if you are patient, it does perform the function of capturing great quality cinematographic up to 4k video up to 60 fps.It works best as an auxiliary additional camera to add in to your setup if you already have a Main DSLR, and use this gimbal camera for specifically shots that you just cannot get with a stationary interchangeable lens DSLR because of their size and lack ofremotely controllable, stabilizing, & tracking gimbal.I believe that is how it is intended to be used. I originally purchased it while my main camera was broken and it really did not work all that well as a main camera, and I was extremely happy to have my main camera come back online and when I was able to start using the pocket two as an additional camera, just to get both another angle for multicam videos as well as shots that a DSLR cannot get, I became quite pleased with its functionality and performance, but it isn’t suited, and just doesn’t lend itself well to functioning like a regular camera, and probably most people know that going in but I had never had a gimbal Camera, at least not handheld like this one, but overall, for what it is and what it is intended to be used for, it really is an awesome little device.One note, I would definitely either get the creator combo or purchase the do it all handle accessory as well as the wireless microphone accessory that come with the creator combo because they work extremely well with the camera and I cannot imagine using it without both of them. Other accessories are nice but those two are absolutely essential in my opinion, both for ease of use as well as performance.If you want the remote functionality & want to add cinematographic shots to your existing abilities, & have the money to spend on the combo, you will not be disappointed, except possibly by the multiple files, Which I cannot find a way to disable, so if anybody does No how to make it record just one file per recording, please comment!Good luck & enjoy
