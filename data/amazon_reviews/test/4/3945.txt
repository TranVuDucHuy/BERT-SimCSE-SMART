First thing first, is the camera WORTH $450? Not yet, but I think in 6 months it will be. I know what you're thinking, how can this be? Well just like Apple and Tesla, Ubiquiti is in the software game and can roll out new features after shipping the hardware.. read on.I have 5 of these, yes you can do the math, I am now poor. But my Trump bucks bought most of them. I have 11 other Ubituiti cameras and YES these are the best picture quality day OR NIGHT. Night vision is down right amazing. With the optical zoom, variable intensity LEDs and the software from UI.Digging around in the firmware of the camera, we can see that UI is working on Image detection (car, dog, human, etc) so once that goes live with the motion alerts, we should see some pretty sophisticated software improvements.The fact that all of this data stays ON PREMISE is amazing.No more data breaches, privacy concerns!UI also makes a doorbell to compete with Ring and everyone else. Combine everything together and you get a VERY nice system. I will be slowly upgrading my other G3flex cameras to G4 Pros. They image quality is that much better.
