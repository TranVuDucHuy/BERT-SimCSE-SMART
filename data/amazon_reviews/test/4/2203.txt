These sound better than the more expensive WF-1000XM4s out of the box thanks to them having a more neutral sound signature.Additionally these have several quality of life improvements over it, including; a brand new set of sounds for activating commands and powering on, multi-point and Google auto-switch, better comfort, and a pairing button on the case.However, the main thing that breaks the deal for me personally is the subpar battery life. Using LDAC Sound Quality preferred, with ANC on, I can only manage to achieve a max of 3 hours of playback time on a good day. On average we're looking at around 2.5 hours of playback time on a full charge. The lack of wireless charging on the case is also a con, however, I'm indifferent towards it.Additionally, EQ-ing the WF-1000XM4s within the Sony Headphones Cconnect app; I can get them to sound better than the LinkBuds S ever could thanks to the XM4s having superior technicalities (imaging in this case).Overall, would I recommend them? Absolutely, but if and only if you're okay with the mediocre battery life.
