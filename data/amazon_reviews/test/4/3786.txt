Â The Akaso 7000 is an improved version of the same cameras I have bought in the past for half or one third the price, but those never worked. This one does work, and makes for a passable bike video,. That's a terrible environment, with lots of shaking. The video not perfectly steady, but is watchable, and doesn't make me dizzy. If I mount the camera on my helmet or on my chest, it should be steadier.When new, the battery lasts over an hour. With a 32GB card, I could capture a 90 minute ride. The touch screen is a nice feature. It does work, and there is a remote on/off switch that I've not tried out yet.The camera can be controlled by a phone App. I've used it on the older models. Should be fineEDIT: I learned from other reviews that the stabilization only works in 1080P, which is luckily where I set mine. I also learned that the date/time is lost when the battery is swapped. Bummer.
