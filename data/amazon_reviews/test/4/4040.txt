This is a great product with a really great video image. The battery life is not very good and you really can't record anything longer than 20 or 30 minutes without recharging it. Unfortunately the hat clip broke after 4 uses. It is not very easy to use and you have to use a good amount of effort to spread it and of course it didn't last long. If you are going to use this for short clips this is definitely the best most compact item. If you are trying to create a video that is 30 minutes or longer forget it.
