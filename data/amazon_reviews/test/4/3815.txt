Easy to set up in the app. The app has a lot more information and options than a similar doorbell type camera I bought 3 years ago.Pros-1. 2 18650 batteries should give good service.2. Easy to dismount from the base, no special screwdriver needed.3. Voice and audio are clear.4. Solid WIFI connection.5. App QR code method makes adding cameras a snap.Cons-1. Siren is so low as to be useless so don't buy it for that.2. Concerned about possible rust on the base.Tips- USB port is micro plug and it can format your SD card when inserted using the app.Update- I bought 2 individual cameras first then the 2 pack. The 2 pack must have been slightly older and required a firmware update. It took about 3 minutes per camera and went smoothly.
