I bought two of these thinking that I could get away with not having to pay a monthly subscription however, to see the full benefits of these you do need to actually buy some sort of a subscription. Through doing some research online I did find a loophole as the company does make a video that tells you, even though they say you need to buy a subscription you can go on and get their basic plan and then put in that you don’t want to pay anything as the monthly premium is just a suggestion, however doing this does not give you the full benefits of detection on this camera. So far the detection and notifications have been a little wonky. Sometimes it detects a shadow from the sun even when I have it on low detection and other times somebody walks right past the path of the camera and it doesn’t notice a thing. Also notifications sometimes will come to my phone after somebody walks in my house. (Family members but you can imagine if they weren’t…) ultimately, I may be being a little harsh on these things honestly for the money it’s still pretty impressive what they can do. I can monitor what’s going on outside from my phone from anywhere as well as talk through these and turn a siren on and the night vision is pretty nice that you couldn’t even see anything so there are some definite pluses to it. It’s just a lot to ask out of a surveillance camera, I think at this price point.
