Edited to say that I am a happy customer and changed my rating. I contacted Kodak and they stood by their product and sent me a replacement. I did enjoy using this (until it broke) and am happy to be able to continue archiving my old memories again now. I am giving it 4 stars - it works well and the scanning process goes fast. Color isn't always the best on some of the older negatives, but you can adjust that. Only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 is because it probably wouldn't be good enough for a professional. But it works well for someone like me who loves their photos and wants to archive their old negatives.This was easy to use and did a quick and decent job of scanning my negatives. But after not using it for about a week, I plugged it in and it wouldn't turn on. Tried a different outlet, nothing. I pulled out the small USB connector that plugged into the unit to make sure it hadn't gotten loose, then tried to plug it back in and the USB connection on the unit itself broke off inside the unit! I bought it in July, so I can't return it. I would give the product a 3-4 star rating, but because of the price and how little time it lasted, it only gets one star from me.
