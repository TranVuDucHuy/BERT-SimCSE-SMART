Printers are like razors. Manufacturers make their money on the ongoing supplies, not the razor or printer. I’ve had some bad experiences with off-brand ink that was well-rated, and I’ve had good luck with some that was supposedly mediocre. If you’re printing very much, and it has to look professional, you just have to spend the money and get the real deal. The XL cartridges are substantially larger and offer a better cost per page, and having them in a bundle is really more about getting all the right cartridges at once then a larger discount. If you print a lot, this is your best bet to have all of the right OEM cartridges on hand when you need them.
