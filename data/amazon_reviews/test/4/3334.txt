I got these to go into Kindle tablets. I was sort of amazed at the price for the capacity, but that's progress I guess. No problems getting them to work with the tablets, they're just regular microSD cards.After a month or so, one of them developed a problem and it became unusable. I could not even put it into another device and format it. Luckily, I had the third one. No further issues after several months.
