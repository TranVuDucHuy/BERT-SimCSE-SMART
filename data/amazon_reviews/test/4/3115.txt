Might be a good camera for the beginner.I've had the T4i for 7 years now. Great camera, tens of thousands of shots. I was greatly anticipating receiving the T8i. The main reason I bought it was because it could do the 4K 24P clean HDMI out. I was going to go with the 90d, but Canon refuses to fix the 24P clean out bug (outputs as 30P even though 24P is selected). My workflow is to blu-ray which means I need 24P. After considering dropping Canon altogether, I decided to stick with the T8i (and hand down my T4i to my daughter and share my lens collection).One thing I did not realize before I bought the camera: it does crop in 4K video mode. I measure about a 2x crop, same shot in 4k video mode at 27mm was about 50mm in photo mode. Maybe it was listed somewhere and I just missed it. So, that's a 1.6x crop sensor plus a 2x crop for 4k video.I recorded to a Ninja V (mainly to be able to break the 30 minute mark). Footage looks good for the price on an entry level camera. Not a huge dynamic range, but it looks good, especially after being able to dial things in with the tools on the Ninja V. No c-log, but that's not expected at this price. I did try recording to the Ninja V and internally to the SD card and could not see any difference in video quality.In manual focus mode, it does give you focus peaking on the camera's screen. Not a horrible feature, but it's probably not going to nail the focus using it unless you're zoomed in.One of the biggest things I'm not happy with is the removal of the exposure compensation button. If you shoot in manual mode, you need this button for quick adjustments. It does allow you to reassign the function to another button, but it's freakin' awkward and not in a comfortable spot like before. Up through the T7i had it, the T8i does not. This alone annoys me and I'd rather shoot photography with my T4i, except for the higher megapixels.With the removal of the exposure compensation button, they've dumbed down the menus. Again, great if I'm handing this to my 12 year old for her to learn on her own. Depending on the mode dial, it shows you and somewhat walks you through changing settings to get different effects (DoF, subject freeze/blur, bracketing). All things that someone who knows basic photography and their way around their camera can do fairly fast. The option can be disabled to give you the traditional menu.I fully expect better cameras to be out in the next few years that will make me switch, even to a different brand. I'm tired of other brands going the extra mile to give the user extra features they want while Canon just sets there telling you to shut up and like what they give you. Or go spend lots of money on their higher end equipment. Definitely my last Rebel if they don't bring back the exposure compensation button. Time will tell.
