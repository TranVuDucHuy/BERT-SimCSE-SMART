I found nothing to dislike with these inexpensive ear buds. The sound quality is excellent and they are comfortable in the ears. I like the wiring also which is designed so as not to get in a tangle. Sound quality is superior with wired earphones of this type. The low and high frquency tend to tail off with the wireless kind.
