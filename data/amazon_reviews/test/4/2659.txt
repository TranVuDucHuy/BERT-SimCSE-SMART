Around 3 years ago I used to fly drones a lot but then I took a break for a long time and just a few weeks ago I started looking for beginner drones so I could get used to them again. The Tello is the best starter drone because it is so easy to fly and learn how to use. Highly recommended. After using this drone for a while I bought a DJI Mini 2.
