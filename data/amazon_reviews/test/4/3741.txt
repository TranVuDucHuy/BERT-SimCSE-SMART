Good little portable projector- lightweight and easy to setup. I used this indoors only to have a large screen for TV and sports. At ~19 feet it projects roughly a 180 inch screen but you can use digital zoom to reduce the overall size by 25%. From what I read the measured ANSI lumens is roughly 250 which means it's only for very dark rooms. As long as you don't have ambient lights on or sunlight you should be able to view the screen easily and the image will be brighter the smaller the distance between the wall and projector. If I was using my cell phone or laptop at the same time I would have to let my eyes adjust to be able to make out details because those screens would be much brighter. I had no issues with image color, brightness, and sharpeness when using a Chromecast hooked up to the single HDMI port.For the price I'd say it's worth it as long as your expectations are in order. For double the price you can get something that's twice as bright as that's probably the sweet spot for portable projectors but if you want something to replace a TV or use with ambient lighting you're going to have to get into spending 5x-10x the money.
