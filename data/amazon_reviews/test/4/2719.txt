The best of these is that they will not fall even if I jump or do whatever, they are super firm.I don't think the sound quality is a 10 but it is very good! The volume could go higher.The controls are a bit difficult to understand and get used to, but they are ok.I think it cancels the environment sound too much for my taste, really can't hear a thing when I have them on. Even if I pause the music, I will need to take them off in case someone speaks to me.The worst thing about these to me, is that the distance from the phone is so short! If I get a meter away it will lose connection, this is very unpractical for me, cannot do some tasks while listening to music because I need to carry the phone, the distance is too small.Also I sometimes lose signal on one of them, it goes off and on so I sometimes hear on one side only for some moments, this is something that is not working ok but they are too new to know if this will happen often.
