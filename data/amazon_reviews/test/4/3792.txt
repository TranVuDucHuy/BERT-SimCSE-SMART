Update: After posting about my original problems with these cameras i was contacted directly by Dekco customer service. After explaining the problem an update was sent to all my cameras that seems to have fixed all the issues. For reference below is my original complaint.Originally, I thought these cameras were a bargain for the price but it turns out you get what you pay for. After any power outage or glitch, they lose their memory of the wifi router they are connected to and require the user to manually add them back in (as if a new camera). In my case this means dragging a ladder around the house to each camera! Additionally, once added back in the camera loses some of the custom settings you may have set. For example, If you are using the onvif capability this requires you to turn it back on and re-establish a password. I have both the 180-degree and 360-degree models and the same is true for both.It should be noted that I own 6 of these cameras and all exhibit the same problem.
