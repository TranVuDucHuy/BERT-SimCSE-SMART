I've been doing wedding videography for a couple of years now and have noticed that generally speaking the only camera angles that I am confident are in focus was the one that my assistant used a video monitor for. Otherwise, using the back of the camera or the EVF just wasn't getting me there, especially when I am using a Log profile that flattens the image. I wanted to try a cheap monitor first to see if it would cut it and I am proud to report that in spite of the somewhat low monitor resolution, the screen is just big enough to confidently pull focus.Sure, it would be nice to load a LUT onto the monitor or have any of the other features that my Atomos Shinobi has, but this monitor was a quarter of the price of that monitor so I can't really complain too much. I'm considering picking up another one of these in the future!
