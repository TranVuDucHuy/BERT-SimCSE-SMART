I just needed a good light and phone mount for small product photography. The price on this model was good enough for my amateur needs so I grabbed this one. It assembles very easily and I do not think anyone will struggle with getting it together. The phone mount is my only complaint. It is very cheaply made and padded, that part is not too bad as long as you are gentle and aware. The annoying part is attaching the mount onto it's screw. It does not stop when tight, so it will go right through to the padding that holds the phone and can make it unlevel. Again, not a real problem if you are aware but it does really show the care that went into the design.
