Bought two of these to keep an eye on our under construction house. Didn’t realize they needed an additional SIM card for activation, so searched YouTube for the best solution and settled on EIOT prepaid annual cards for about $100 each. Highly recommend that! Plug and play!Mounted both to trees on our 2.5 acre property and had to remount the solar panel on one to catch more sun that it was getting in the shaded portion of the tree. Nice long cord makes that very easy without moving the whole camera.Best thing about these is the ability to quickly check in at any time and the picture and sound quality. Much better in the day that at night. The night vision is meant for objects 10-20 yards ahead , otherwise it’s just shadows. And now today with rain, it’s a complete mess with rain on the lens.Havent had success with motion detection fine tuning yet, even after driving around directly in front of the cameras. so still fine tuning that.The ability to tilt and pan was the thing that sold me on these, BUT….. the “thumb” control is super sensitive and knows zero boundaries, especially up and down. Usually takes me a good 5-10 minutes to get the camera back where I need it to be after I move it around.Overall, glad I could see my property. Wish it was fine tuned more with the motion, night vision, and tilt functions. 3.5 out of 5
