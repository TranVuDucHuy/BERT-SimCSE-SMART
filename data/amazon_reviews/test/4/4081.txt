This mount was great but installing it took forever. We followed all of the directions, but things were not always easily marked and the directions did not always give enough detail. There are some helpful YouTube videos if the directions are not enough. There is also an option to tilt it to level once up. This feature was difficult for us to figure out and once we did, it seemed like it would not actually stay in the tilted direction we wanted it. Other than that, it has been great as far as being able to move the TV in different directions and sturdiness.
