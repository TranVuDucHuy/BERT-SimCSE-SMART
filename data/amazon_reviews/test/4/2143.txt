This is the second set of Jabra headphones I've purchased. The first set was not wireless, but the second set was. Unfortunately, both headphones broke at the swivel point where the speaker attaches to the headband. I regretted purchasing the first set because it was not wireless and decided to keep it until at some point I would purchase the wireless set in the future. That decision was accelerated when the headphones broke at the swivel point. I purchased the (second) Jabra wireless set and those also broke at that same swivel point. Both sets lasted less than a year. I'll likely buy something cheaper even if it is of poorer quality. I can't afford buying replacement headphones at that price. Thanks for listening.
