I’m through just a few frames, and the camera is the fun little gadget it lived up to be. I’m mostly back in this product page to verify it should come with a wrist strap and batteries — neither were in my package. Not a disaster since I have batteries, but ordering the wrist strap separately is inconvenient. The Fuji support page is not helpful at all. Won’t stop me from using the camera, but I’ll keep it in mind with future orders.
