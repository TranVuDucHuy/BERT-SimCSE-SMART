It's not as fluffy/puffy as the picture and it is more of an oval shape compared to the donut shape as advertised but it is soft. Yes, it is bottomless so you will need to use the pillows that come with or even stuff some blankets or scarves in the middle and then prop the baby with the pillows. It still works for babies and possibly up to 3 months old if baby is on the smaller side.
