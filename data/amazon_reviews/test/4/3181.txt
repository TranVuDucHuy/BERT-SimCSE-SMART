I am super excited about my new JEPWCO G4 Pro Anti-Spy Detector and you should too. It is very lightweight allowing for easy portability. It only has a few buttons, making it extremely easy to use. The laser is bright and the alarm sounds are audible. It has accurately detected various signals that I have around my apartment so it definitely works. Highly Recommend!
