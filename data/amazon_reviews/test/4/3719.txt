Easy to install, easy to setup, easy to set up the basics.I can get all the basics done with it. "Person at front door." Okay, great - show me on my phone or TV. Done.How about this? When it detects said motion at front door, my front door light should turn on. Can I program this? No. I can program it to turn the lights on when the camera turns *on*. As in, when it is powered up. Seriously?Or this? "Jim NC seen in living room." Okay, cool. How about we don't get alerts for a partner or ourselves or anyone else we choose. I get an alert every time *I* walk near my back door, and I've caught myself ignoring alerts - a terrible habit for this to instill.I get that Nest was The Best. I get that Google broke it. I get that Google is working to make it better. I also get that Hangouts was the best messaging platform - until Google tried to make it work better.When these are on rock-bottom-price sales, pick them up. They're excellent hardware, a subscription is inexpensive, and they just work. I've had Amcrest, ZModo and other cameras that just... didn't work but cost about the same as these on super-sale (or at least in the same ballpark). Google's software is lacking, but at least it's stable and familiar.
