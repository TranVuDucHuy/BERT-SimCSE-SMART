To start: I’m a harsh reviewer. I may like a product and use it but still give it poor marks. SO, 4 stars from me really means something.I’ve had and used it for a month. To start, as far as I can tell, this product really does hold up against sweat. I’ve been absolutely drenched, sweat pooling up in my ears, and these things have been just fine.Battery: every use has been “battery full,” even with substantial use every day.Sound: it’s not beats quality, nor is it audiophile friendly, BUT, it’s honestly just about as good as apple AirPods.Noise canceling: fair, but requires a good seal, which is easily lost.Case durability: surprisingly capable! I wouldn’t expect it to hold up to a rough kid or serious damage, but everyday use is excellent.-also, the rise in the case with the JBL branding on the lid is essentially a “fuller,” which provides additional structural integrity. The fact that they took the thought and time to add that is impressive and commendable.-and: the charger that is attached to the bottom of the case is custom, and thoughtfully made. Most of it is a rubber-like material, except for the actual metal pins, thus, it’s more resilient to moisture damage (such as the kind likely to occur if you keep it in your pockets on a hot and sweaty day or workout!)-another note about the charger is that it seems to be one of those “universal” ones, where you don’t have to flip it to get it into the usb slot.Additional notes: the actual earphones are magnetized with the case, so they have a really satisfying feeling when you put them in and take them out.-Bluetooth connection is fairly stable, even with me leaving the phone in one room and going to another.-the only weak point is the lid, but it’ll hold up fine to everyday use (i suspect it’ll only break from substantial drops, or exceptional sheer force, such as at the bottom of a bag with heavy objects).-the only con I have is that every time I adjust the earbuds while workout out, it’ll trigger the rewind button, but I can’t consistently get the tap feature to work when I’m intentionally trying to use it.
