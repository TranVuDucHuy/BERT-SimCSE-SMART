Overall this is a good option if you are looking to step your lenses from EF-M to either EF or EF-S lens mounts. The auto focus worked fine, and there was no noticeable difference in performance. My only complaint is that the EF-M mount side had reduced tolerances when manufactured so it sat a little loose when fully secured in. Nothing that would cause major issues, but certainly might be noticed with heavier/longer lenses if not mounted to a tripod. Buying one with a weather seal would likely solve the issue.
