I've had these headphones for a few months now, so I can properly give my honest review. I'll rate this off of a few things: Comfort, "Noise Cancelling", Sound, Battery, and Hold.For starters, these are very soft (but loose) headphones. Because they're loose, it's comfortable. It doesn't hurt my ears, and I'm a person who has spikey earrings. I wore these all throughout a road trip I took. Never hurt my ears once. I even slept in them because my brother was snoring in our hotel, and it cancelled it out quite well!That takes us to the "noise cancelling" feature. It's cool, but it's really not that good. It doesn't cancel at all. It muffles sounds around you from far away, but up close you can still hear others speaking with you, which is a nice feature in busy rooms for those with auditory processing issues! This feature can be navigated by pressing the on button once, to where you'll hear a voice say "AFC on" and "AFC off to listen to regular music again.The sound is surprisingly good, and it's held up just as well for the 5 months I've own these. They get fairly loud actually, and the quality is good! Suits my tastes. However, if you listen to it too loud the sound does leak.The battery life however is scarily good. It hasn't drained that much, like a phone does over time, and the battery gets worse, y'know? Thes have held up well. I wouldn't be surprised if it's more like 60 hours of battery life. On my 9 day road trip, I only had to charge for small amounts like once or twice... and I would be sitting with my headphones on in the car for 9 hours a time sometimes. I use them every day before school, within my first 90 minute period, and through the day, and on the way home. Every day. For a week. And by the end of the week, they're still at 60% battery! It's amazing. Airpods could seriously never, or Lunexpods which I've also tried. Never seen a better battery life.With all of these nice features, they feel fragile when I hold them. I have a bad habit of breaking things, though. I haven't broken these yet! They still feel like they'll break, though... Thin headband. And the ear parts rotate and they feel like they'll fall off. 5 months strong still, baby!Okay, I hope this was helpful!! I couldn't recommend these more, still. I love them! and they're stylish at least to me. Cause I wear a lot of black and red, they match.
