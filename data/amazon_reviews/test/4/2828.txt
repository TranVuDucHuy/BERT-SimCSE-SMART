So I'm happy with this purchase. I liked the fact that it included a hole saw. Everything you need is included.Tip:Don't forget to screw the cap the holds the power bridge romex plug to the extender.I completely neglected to do that and when I plugged the extender cable the thing popped inside. It was a pain to get the wing holders to retract but I made it happened.The instructions are a bit confusing in some areas but overall it is well diagram with large pics and fonts.I definitely recommend this simple power bridge for the average DIYer.
