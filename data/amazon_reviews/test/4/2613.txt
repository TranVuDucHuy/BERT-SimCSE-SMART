These are my first real pair of binos. I got these as a surprise gift for my wife for our trip to the Everglades. Apparently there are lots of birds there lol. She like birds. Me, eh…not my bag so much. Compared to the gift shop binos at the national park, these are amazing.The optics are razor sharp. They are as sharp as the pictures taken from my mirrorless camera lenses costing 8x as much. I was surprised at the clarity and sharpness. The first thought that ran through my head was I need to get a longer range pair but I snapped back to reality. The 8x28 is perfect. I think the next size up would have too much “shake” making it harder to zero in on the object. She would complain and I’d never hear the end of it. Ugh. These can “shake” a little but it’s not that noticeable, as others have mentioned. The distance is nice.The controls and adjustability are top notch. It stays where you left it.The size and weight is very manageable. It’s not too heavy so you can carry this around all day and it won’t hurt your neck.It comes with a nice case that includes a shoulder strap for the case and a neck strap for the binos. Incidentally, the rubber eye cover loop is not broken, it is split by design. That is so you can remove the rubber cover and still have it attached to the neck strap on one side. Otherwise, it would be hard to use with the rubber cap attached to both sides of the neck strap.What I didn’t like about it…The rubber eye covers, the eye side, comes off rather easily when you put it in the case. The large side rubber cover also comes off too easily. I wish these snapped on or took a little more force to pull off.The metal strap loops are too small. You can only slide a single flat strap through it. So any strap thicker than that won’t fit. I had purchased a OP/TECH strap thinking I could install it but I can’t. It’s wider so it’s more comfortable and usually the included straps are junk-but the included neck strap is okay.All in all my experience with the first real pair of binos has been stellar. I’ve purchased a red dot sight from vortex previously and it has been great. Vortex as a company continues to impress me with these binos.
