Poe NVR, i would have given it 5 stars if it could support the TrackMix battery/solor wifi camera. Tech support informed me that NO the Battery Wifi cameras are not supported. So Please Reolink help support this feature in next future firmware. This NVR comes with 2tb surveillance Seagate hard drive (up-gradable to 6tb single drive/12tb max and i did upgrade it with the Western Digital 6tb purple surveillance.) There is no room inside for a second hard drive, so you must use eSata port and enclosure for the second hard drive. If yours get to hot, there is the Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX two wire 40x10mm fan that can be installed inside, a video can be found on YouTube. NVR can be access by client app for Windows, Mac, and Android. The two features i like is setting up local lan FTP for important backup storage and mail service for notification.
