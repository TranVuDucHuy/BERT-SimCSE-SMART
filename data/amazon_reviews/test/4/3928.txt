My son (8 yo) has been using an Instax film camera for about 4 years and we’ve limited his picture taking so as not to fill our house with Instax cards. Also I wanted him to carefully consider a subject before snapping a picture.Now I want him to just take pictures and play with settings without worrying about film. This camera is perfect for that use. It has a few features to test, a modest (maybe substandard zoom), and decent picture quality.As a note on battery life, you need to use lithium AA or you’ll burn right through batteries. The first lithiums I gave my son are about 300 pictures in and still going strong.All in all this is not a camera for someone looking to beat out their smartphone. It won’t. It’s a good camera to learn with. I’m happy so far.
