I will preface this review by saying that I am a complete amateur with pulling hard drives and trying to access them. I had never attempted it before now. It was not as scary or difficult as I'd imagined; however, I have now thoroughly learned that I should create a Windows recovery usb or disc, and I should back up any files regularly, since computers like to crash.After some research, I ordered this adapter unit, and used it to try to access and transfer data from two drives, but it stopped working with the IDE drive I had. I exchanged it, and the second unit had the same problem. The smaller, non-IDE drive worked perfectly. The monstrous old IDE drive didn't work, after working well enough in the very beginning when I first plugged it in. I had unplugged it to try a different, smaller, non-IDE drive, and afterward, the adapter stopped working for the IDE drive. My $&#**^% Windows 10 computer refused to recognize the IDE drive, and it just made noises.It is possible that it is a problem with the drive, but I felt that the drive was not getting enough power, or a setting was wrong somewhere. The adapter unit was behaving oddly. Then, when I poked around my computer system, I could see the adapter plugged into my computer and that the hard drive was there, but my computer would not allow me to access the drive.Anyway, the 4-pin power connection for the IDE drive to the adapter unit was very difficult to plug in and unplug, and that part of the whole adapter unit seemed a little cheap. The rest of the adapter unit was fine, and it was nice to have an on/off power switch. I ended up buying a different external hard drive case for the smaller drive, and I'm still considering possible solutions for the IDE drive.If you know what you are doing, this adapter unit is probably great for you. If you have easy hard drives to access, this adapter unit will probably be great for you. I wish I could have kept it for future use, but if it wasn't going to work for the IDE drive, it wasn't as useful to me.
