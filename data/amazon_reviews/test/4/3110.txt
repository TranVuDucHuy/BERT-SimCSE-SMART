I’ve never owned a projector before so take my advice with a grain of salt. I have zero doubt you can get a better projector but I’m sure you’d have a hard time finding anything significantly better at the same price. I paid a little over $100 at the time of purchase.-Don’t bother with wireless screen mirroring. It’s simply too laggy for anything but still images.-I tried wired screen mirroring and it is much better but will not work for copy protected material (like Netflix)-HDMI works just fine. I used two different USB C hubs with HDMI to connect my MacBook Air. One worked, one did not. If this is important to you I recommend an adapter. My XBox One X is currently connected over HDMI and it does everything I need it it too, so I haven’t tried anything else.-I recommend a screen. At first I projected to my wall which is white but textured and painted with a semi gloss. I purchased a very basic portable screen without a stand or anything and, just pinned to my wall it made a noticeable difference. Since then I have purchased another that is closer in size to the largest image I can make in my available space-The fan is loud, no other way to describe it. It’s not so loud that you can’t hear the speaker but it is fatiguing. I use it to watch TV at night while my son sleeps so I already use noise cancelling headphones and they work really well.-The speaker is just adequate. It’s loud enough and it’s clear enough. If you’re doing movie night for kids or grandkids, they likely won’t even notice. But it’s no Dolby Atmos. External speakers might be better but you would still need to contend with the fan noise.-It claims to do a 1080p image and it certainly looks good enough for streaming. It even auto switches between 60 hz and 24hz based on the source material.Bottom line: can you get a better projector? Oh yeah, absolutely. Can you get a better one at this price? Maybe. But if good enough is all you need, it’s hard to go wrong for around $100, plus another $20-$50 for a decent screen.
