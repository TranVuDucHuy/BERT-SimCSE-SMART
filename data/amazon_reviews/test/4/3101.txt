As far as security cameras go, this thing is absolutely worth the price tag. For years I've used Amcrest cameras. I have some "2K" cameras, and the picture is definitely better quality than the Wyze Cam v3, however, that's kind of a given seeing how the Wyze cam's are 1080p. So of course it will be lower.But where the Wyze camera shines is night vision. It's absolutely bonkers how good the night vision is on these things, especially when it's low light, but not dark enough to switch to infrared.They're incredibly easy to set up and use.My ONLY complaint with them is that the power cord is permanently part of the camera. I'm not usually a fan of that as it seems like it could be a point of failure...but at this price tag, it's probably worth it since you can buy 2-3 of these cameras for the same price as it's competitors.
