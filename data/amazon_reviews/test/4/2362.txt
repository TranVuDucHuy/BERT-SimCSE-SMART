Instructions are very difficult to understand. The VESA different screws were not enough and at the end I couldn’t find the 2 screws that were supposed to be placed at the tilt up and down to secure the TV. I had to improvise with other TV mounts unused screws. I will have to visit HD or a hardware store to look for something that fit and locks TV when tilting it.The anchors were right. It’s sturdy and has a long hand, so one can move and turn the TV.It gives you a lot of view options.
