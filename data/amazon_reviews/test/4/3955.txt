Pros:* Built-in streaming apps for Disney+, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, YouTubeTV....all your standard major players.* Durable little unit you can throw in the case and haul around in your backpack* The auto-keystone/color adjustment works better than I'd have guessed.* Runs from my Anker PowerHouse* Hidden tripod mountCons:* Pricey* Performance is meh, could use a faster processor* The included base could be more functional* NOT short throwFor the most part, I'm happy with this projector....When I first unboxed it, I was feeling a little buyer's remorse; we were looking for a larger-screen option for the 40" (maybe 42?) you see in the side-by-side pic. That photo, by the way, was taken mid-afternoon with regular window shades (not blackout curtains) down, against a light gray-green painted wall. So pretty solid display in those conditions. Absolutely watchable, and it gets better as the room gets darker.The first problem that jumped out, was the lack of flexibility with the stand they included. There was no tripod attachment, as one might expect. After a couple of days, I took the included stand off, thinking I'd try to drill through it and add a tripod mount....but it turns out, the stand is connected on both sides with plastic anchors driven into standard tripod-mount holes. I just attached a 1/4" swivel ball tripod mount to the hole opposite the power cable, then put that on a tripod, and it works great.Second, this is not a short throw projector. I knew that going in, but I still hoped I'd be able to get a decent sized image within a couple of feet. That's on me; "hope" is not a documented feature.The portability, built-in apps, and easy setup make up for it, though; I'm not using this projector the way I expected to, but I am still having fun with it....It works against the garage door, or the concrete wall in the back yard, and I can toss it in the bag with my computer if I need to project something for work. I probably won't replace that TV with it, but -- other than the price tag -- I don't regret buying it.I got the case for free with the preorder; the case is solidly built but a dumb design, but that's a separate review (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R45KWI7LNMDEH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09NWLFGCS).
