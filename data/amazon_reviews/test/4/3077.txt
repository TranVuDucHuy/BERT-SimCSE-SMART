I bought this specifically for the 40x zoom since my iPhone digital zoom is trash.This is great for wildlife encounters in daily life, and that’s it. The image quality is abysmal for selfies although there’s a flip up screen so if you are looking for a selfie cam this is not the one. If you want a selfie camera, get the NX mini from Samsung, or an RX100 series from Sony-which both sport a 1” sensor. Or get the Panasonic LX10 since that has a f1.4 which is great for portraits.I took this out just now to take photos of squirrels and it has served it’s purpose well. The weather condition was cloudy with a bit rain, but it still served well in taking photos in mediocre lighting. Note that it’s not weatherproof so always listen to the weather forecast before taking it out.Overall. This is the best compact zoom that servers the longest zoom range with a decent price point and purpose if you know what you are using it for.
