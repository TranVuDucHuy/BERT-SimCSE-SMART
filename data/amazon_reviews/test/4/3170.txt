I have been looking for a camera to keep an eye on my puppy while I'm work. The challenge has been that I can NOT have a mobile device with me at work. I was surprised how many cameras (Blink, Furbo, Nest) don't offer a web portal to view on a PC. I actually bought a Ring Inside camera knowing they have a web portal but alas, I could not see the live view from my work PC because of a VPN. Another issue with accessing Ring was that they require 2FA, which is not really possible if I don't have my mobile device with me. Believe me I understand the need for security, but that just made it all the more difficult for me. So I returned the Ring and continued my search.I stumbled upon Blurams, who I had never heard of. I read their website and reviews and even reached out to their support team who replied in a very timely manner stating that the live view should work with a VPN. So I gave it a shot and BINGO! It works! I can keep an eye on my puppy from my work PC, and there is no 2FA to deal with either. While all this is great for my purposes, it may be of concern for others who are more security conscious.Picture quality is comparable to the Ring, though maybe not quite as crisp. In low light it switches to black and white. I like that I can remotely turn the camera in 4 directions, and I can even zoon in. That was an unexpected feature for such an inexpensive little camera.I will also note that I do no see any option to save recordings which is fine for me, but may not work for others. It looks like I can scroll back 24 hours, but that's all there is in the way of history. Something to keep in mind if you were looking for more of a monitoring situation. But for a very reasonably priced real time puppy or baby monitor you can easily view from a mobile device OR a website, this will do the job.
