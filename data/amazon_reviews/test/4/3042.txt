Wyse wired cameras are trouble free as far as maintaining connection and use with Alexa vs the wireless Wyze camera which are a joke. This camera and floodlight works very well, just as you would hope. The only challenge is installation. The mounting screws are too long. Either you drill and tap the enclosure to take the length of the screws or buy shorter 3/8" long 10-24 screws. You choose.Night vision is ok with the camera. Has this funky dark, white flash and then even illumination. I not sure how the engineers can avoid the sensor taking a second to correct for illumination. It does have good night vision with the flood lights in the dark non-lighted back of the house. A little slow in reacting to the cats walking through.Been up now for three weeks. Working well.
