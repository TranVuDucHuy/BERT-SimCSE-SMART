I love that these super bright lights can be dimmed to the intensity that you want. They were easy to install and setup. The motion detection is highly adjustable. With a memory card in it you donâ€™t need to pay for additional video recording services. The only downside is that the stem holding the camera and detector is not very stiff so it can be easily moved by hand or with a serious gust of wind. Also, the dead bugs accumulate around the lights and camera. If only these LEDs could be anti-bug yellow.
