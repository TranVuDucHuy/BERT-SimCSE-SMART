I am a newbie and owning two other go to scopes this is my favorite scope because of this starsense app .Navigating star to star planet to planet is easy and fun. With that said you are buying the starsense app .Full moons will make this app useless and maybe partly cloudy nights depends on how many stars it can find.This dx 102 refractor is not heavy so this is a plus but beginner scopes are cheaply made. I say this because the first week the wing nut stripped off into the leg of the tripod so I fixed it myself.I have seen Jupiter and its moons, mars, saturns rings ,venus ,and some nebulas. Looking at a bright moon the scope does have some false colors around the moon.The holding tray is ok but you have to remove it to close the legs. I do recommend this to anyone with no experience in astronomy to give this a try.
