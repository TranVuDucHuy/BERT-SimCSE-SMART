Good for the price. The noise cancelling is decent, but not as good as I would like it to be. Sound quality is ok. But there is a feature that is very important for me: they are very comfortable. My head is kind of wide and my hears a lil large, so I almost always have problems with headsets, however I can wear this in the office for 2 hours straight and no pain. And the buttons are very easy to find and use.
