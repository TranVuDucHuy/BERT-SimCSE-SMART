The sound quality is good. Battery life could be better. Stays in place on ears pretty well. One thing disturbs me. When I first put them on the sound is so loud I think it could cause damage to the ears and it is difficult to lower the volume. It would be great if the volume level would just stay where you put it until you manually change it but when I take them off to charge and put them on again they blast my ears until I struggle with the volume to get it to the right level.
