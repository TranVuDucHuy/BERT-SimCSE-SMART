I love this thing! It’s slim and works perfectly. I just wish the blue lights in the Watch area would turn off after a while or something because at night by my nightstand it’s annoyingly bright. But I’m very sensitive and have to have extreme blacked out curtains and no lights on. So yeah, might try to cover that area with a small tape or sticker.
