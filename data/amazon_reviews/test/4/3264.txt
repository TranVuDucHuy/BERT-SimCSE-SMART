So I originally bought this as an "upgrade" to my Canon EOS RP when my RP fell off my tripod and broke on me. I am a photographer/niche clothing model that works solo and needs a camera with good features for working by myself. Usually this means having a camera with good WiFi that I can tether my phone to and do a 10 second timer with burst photo mode. My Canon EOS RP could do that beautifully. The Canon EOS R cannot. The R has great WiFi, has the 10 second timer, but it DOES NOT have the burst mode which is critical for me. This was not mentioned anywhere that I could find in official documentation for the EOS R, and I was out in the field working solo on the shoot of my Techwear Kiba Cosplay (see attached image) is when I discovered this feature was missing. After realizing that, I immediately came to the conclusion I had to return the EOS R since it couldn't fulfill my needs. Thankfully I was able to get my EOS RP fixed for free via the Amazon protection plan I had purchased along with my RP when I first got it. So now I've gone back to my RP and I'm still very happy with it. Honestly the RP is a highly underrated camera, and I would entirely recommend that over the R if you don't need the advanced video features of the R.
