I have purchased three packages of 3 over the course of a year. I use them in my kids tablets (fire) and some camera's that record 24/7 at 2K. They mostly have all worked fine except I did have one in my camera go bad and it's now in write protected mode and can't be used. I am able to pull off non corrupted data that is left on the card but the card has locked itself from being changed.
