I have used the EOS R for 10 days or so, I have over 3k exposures. I am switching from a 5d iv, I do not use it for video.Here are the things I like:-Great picture quality-Silent Shutter-Works with my 24-70 f2.8 II, 70-200 f2.8IS II and other lenses without a problem with the adapter.-Single point single shot Autofocus works great.-MOST of the time face detection with Eye detection works.-Ring on the adapter(Sold separately), I have set ut up for Aperture, I really like this even though the ring is a bit to close to the camera.-The FV mode is probably my favorite new feature.-Great battery life, not sure how they measure the battery life for the specs, but I am getting an average of 900 photos per charge.-Touch Screen as good as the 5d ivThings that I need to get used to-Touch and Drag autofocus-Multi-function bar, I have programmed it to ISO, left side ISO 100, right side ISO 3,600, it works.Things that need improvement:-Face Autofocus, it works great 90% of the time, but sometimes just decides that the hands or a chair are the face.-The touch and drag autofocus can be more responsive, meaning when I touch the screen while looking through the viewfinder the to change the focus point sometimes I need to swipe a few times to get to the point I want. I have tested different options, like mapping the screen to 1/4, to 1/2 to absolute and relative. It works but not as good as it could!-Bursts silent shooter.-More options to customize the buttons. For example, I would like to not only program the back button for Back Button Focus but to go to specify what type of autofocus (single/servo, single point or different areas, etc...)In conclusion, I am very happy with the EOS R and know that when Canon releases a firmware upgrade I will be really really happy with the camera!Update!After a few months of using this I found out that the silent shutter works in certain circumstances but if you are going to use your camera to photograph in events that use LED lights or indoors under LED lights be aware that you will get terrible banding, basically useless.
