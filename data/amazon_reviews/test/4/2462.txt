I got this for some video experiments I was doing, I was considering s youtube blog... but its not for me.PROS: records digital video to SD card. Video look pretty typical for a camcorder. I can't say I really see the difference of 1080p or 720... so whatever.CONS: I started with too large of a SD card inside. .that trip didn't get any video because I didn't realize there is a size limit on the memory. I found a 64Gb to put in and that worked well enough.Overall, I can't say I use it much nor do I know cameras that great to really review it well. its does what I need when I do use it.
