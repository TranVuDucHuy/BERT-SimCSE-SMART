***UPDATE: BUTTON FUNCTION MAPPING OPTIONS TOO LIMITED***Ok after a couple of weeks regular use I've realized the limited button mapping is a real problem. With a bud that has only one button we should be able to map any function to any action. This is not possible. Should be an easy fix but jaybird does not seem motivated to do so. As a result I've found myself trying to shove and hold the one button to change volume at speed on a bike on a gnarly trail. The powerbeats were brilliant for this as they have a rocker for volume. Also the jaybirds have a real problem with wind despite jaybird's efforts. Finally when running with the vistas I can hear every footfall transmitted into my ear. I still think they sound MUCH better than powerbeats, and are probably ok for some exercise activities. But not great for demanding running or biking activities, which is my primary use for a bud. I might keep these because they sound so good. But I'm going to have to get another pair of powerbeats for serious activity.***END UPDATE***The priorities you insist upon and the compromises you can live with will drive your earbud choice. If you are looking at the jaybird vista 2 chances are you are going to use this for exercise and quite possibly vigorous exercise - that certainly is my priority in earbud functionality. Other people may value price, design, sound, anc, call clarity or battery life more.I am coming from powerbeats pro. I lost those. I think they may show up but until them i had to get something else. The fact that I bought something else might tell you something about the powerbeats. I mountain bike in nasty conditions and it is essential that my earbuds be secure and tough.Here is what I think according to how I value bud qualities1. These work great as exercise buds. They are very secure during vigorous exercise. Their spec dictates that they should be able to withstand nasty conditions. Time will tell, obviously. The powerbeats were very secure as well and also stood up to many months of wet, sweat and abuse.2. Sound. These sound really good. Better than the powerbeats. The powerbeats sounded adequate but had typical beats sculpting and boosting. These sound much more natural and nuanced. I would love to hear them against the master&dynamic that have much larger drivers and tout their audiophile chops.3. Connectivity. These set up and connected no problem and there has been no dropping or interference. The powerbeats were theoretically better because of their apple specific chip and sometimes connected to my iphone like magic but often one bud wouldnt connect or one bud would fail to charge properly. So annoying. These charge reliably no problem.4. Comfort. The powerbeats were very comfortable for extended sessions. These are comfortable for awhile but after that my ear canal and pinnae become aware of them and before long they get a little uncomfortable. The available adapters are limited so you are kinda stuck if your ear is sensitive or has atypical anatomy.5. Controls. I think all exercise centric earbuds need to have more comprehensive on bud controls. The setup on the powerbeats was simple, elegant and effective. The vistas not so much: there is one button on each bud. The button takes a lot of pressure to activate and the control schemes are not that intuitive with limited customization. So making changes while on the move is possible but not easy or ideal.4. ANC. The powerbeats had nothing, not even any passive 'sealing'. These offer both moderate passive sealing and fairly effective ANC.5. Design. These have a really sleek looking and elegant design. The powerbeats were nice too in a very different way. These fall somewhere between something 'bespoke' like master&dynamic and something dull like the sony or bose offerings.6. Calls. So far i have had a couple of people mention that they couldn't hear me so well. The powerbeats always provided very clean calling performance.7. Wind. The app has wind blocking modes and the buds themselves apparently have some sort of wind muting material. Forget it wind (like cycling or riding in an open jeep) is a real problem. This is probably too much to ask of earbuds but suffice to say that whatever efforts jaybird made in this direction have probably fallen short.8. The app is ok but shouldn't be a selling point. It's better than the powerbeats that had no app at all.So for core requirements both these and the powerbeats are excellent for vigorous exercisers. These sound better, connect more reliably and provide good anc. The powerbeats were far better with on-bud control, more comfortable, and provided better call performance. Given the +/- comparison I'd buy these over the powerbeats again.
