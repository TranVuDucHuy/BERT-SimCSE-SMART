I have had this camera for about two months. (I had to get something to replace my Amazon Cloud Cam, which they stopped supporting.) It came with a month of premium service, and now I just have the free account with three hours of memory. The picture quality is excellent, even at night, and the colors are bright. It was easy to set up.My issue is that it does not detect or record my cat walking around the house. Even when I had the premium service with more storage, it never recorded a single motion incident with my pet. It detected and recorded my petsitter, but not my cat. So basically I can see a live feed of my cat if he happens to be in the room with the camera, but no recordings from earlier in the day.I also had to turn off sound recording because it caused a feedback whine. And the green "on" light is extremely bright. Overall it's a good camera, but I miss my Cloud Cam.
