This is a decent camera if you are looking to have some type of security in the house without spending a lot of money. The picture Quality is decent, the night vision is pretty good, and the motion detector is slightly off but still good. Itâ€™s an easy setup. I do love the alerts that come to my phone when motion is detected. I love the two way talk system as well. Now this could be a little better because it kinda lags when talking your responses. Like the person on the camera has a hard time hearing you. But it was in my price range for the moment and it does get the job done.
