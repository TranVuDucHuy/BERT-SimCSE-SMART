I don't have much to compare this product to as I am new to telescopes and just getting to know the basics. What I can say is this kit seems like it brings out the best in an amateurs backyard space exploration. I am absolutely positive that this is NOT the best set available on the market based off of product feedback and general knowledge but it will definitely be a nice finishing touch to those who are attempting to get the most out of their scope. For those that are new to this and wondering what exactly everything does, *You can probably stop reading by now if you have a general experience of how scopes/lenses/filters work*.General Information For Newbies like myself: (Don't trust me word for word this is only from my understanding)The barlow lens attaches to the scope that you can then place any other lens into the barlow to get essentially a 2x magnification level.The size in MM of the lens represents its magnification power. The shorter the lens (Small MM) the more magnification. a 13mm lens is more "powerful" than a 32mm lens. (Don't let the physical size fool you).The planetary filters alter the contrast of the image and help show "features" of objects that you otherwise wouldn't/couldn't see, they also do a good job at filtering out excess light so that you can actually see what you are looking at rather than having it seem to be looking at pretty much the same object no matter what planet or star you are on (for those that have weaker scopes).The moon filter is very nice at reducing the light as described. Makes things much more enjoyable and easy on the eye. I noticed after viewing the moon for a while without the filter I couldn't see much of what was around me being so dark out. The filter really reduced that effect.Tips: Experiment around a little, don't be discouraged if you can't get it all figured out in one night and find your way to all of the planets and stars. As helpful as the filters can be they can also hurt. For faint objects through a low powered scope it can make some objects barely visible at best depending on visual magnitude. Remember the smaller the lens in size and MM the bigger the power. That also happens to mean that you might get a much more distorted/fuzzy image and objects WILL be harder to locate. I don't have a fancy "GOTO" scope (one that finds whatever you want it to for you). I've learned through the small amount of experience that I have to start with a higher number MM lens and find what I'm looking for and then change out the lens carefully and slowly and fine tune as needed... The 8mm and especially 6mm lenses are virtually useless to me as I haven't been able to get them trained and tuned on anything. (This might be due to my "cheaper" scope).Final Thought: The eye relief has much room for improvement... Most of the time with the short lenses the only thing I saw was my own eyelashes... Another reason the short lenses haven't helped me out. (eye relief gets better with the longer lenses, and for those that don't know it's the amount of space between the actual lens and your eye). Hence, if you have your eye pressed against the lens you might see your pretty little batty eyelashes instead of the cosmos.Good luck and see you at Saturns rings! ;)
