We use this baby monitor currently, but it is not my favorite.I like that it is wifi based and has a camera that moves and senses motion and sound, however, the quality of the camera is in black and white and when the monitor is on its stance, you don't get a clear view of the image.It does provide music from the monitor to the camera, temperature gauges of the baby room, and the camera can move in many different angles.I am not sure that you can mount it against a wall as it needs a shelf to really sit on.It works for now, but if you want something with more technology, I would go a different route.
