These are not cheap. They are made nicely. I love the stand and the noise cancelling feature. I hear a few seconds of "crackling" now and then. Not sure why that is happening. I can tolerate it, but feel it shouldn't be happening. That's why I bought these and not bluetooth headphones for the TV. It is nice that I can use them to hear the TV and can also use the volume on the tv for others to watch at the same time. The headphones have their own volume control. Easy to set up and keep charged. I have used them for hours watching movies. Very nice headset.
