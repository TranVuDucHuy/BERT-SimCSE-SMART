I prefer headphones to earbuds, but at work, I usually have one ear free, so buds work better. The sound is great, especially if you want bass, the bass mode amps the bass up but doesn't drown out, or overshadow the treble instruments. My inly thing is, and this is probanly for all earbuds, make sure you clean them with a cotton swab and rubbing alcohol. My left bud was losing sound, and I could barely hear a thing most days. I realized over time, all the wax and grime, thats usually in an ear, collected on the speaker screen. Once I took a tooth pick to scrap the crud, and a cotton swab with alcohol, the sound came right back!
