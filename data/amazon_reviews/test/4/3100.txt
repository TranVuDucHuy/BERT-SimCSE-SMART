I got this camera for my wife's hedgehog encloser. We are pleasantly surprised with its performance. The 1080p HD video quality is great and the color night vision is a fantastic feature that sets this camera apart from others. The 2-way audio is also a handy feature and makes it easy to communicate with anyone near the camera. The app is user-friendly and provides a lot of options for customization, such as setting motion detection zones and adjusting video quality. The camera is also very easy to install and the magnetic base makes it easy to mount in various locations. The price is unbeatable for the quality of the product and the features offered. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5-star rating is because I have experienced some connectivity issues, but these have been few and far between. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great value in a security camera. Good for the price.
