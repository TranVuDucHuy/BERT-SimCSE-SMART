I was in the market for a camera that can pan and tilt. I can across ZUMIMALL and for the price you do get quite the feature packed system. I switched from Arlo because their camera are too expensive. I since purchased 5 ZUMIMALL cameras and rigged them all over the house and have great coverage and 2K quality.Things I like:1: Super easy to install. Easy to understand instructions2: good features for a good price3: though it doesnâ€™t say it on their manuals I did confirm that if your Wifi goes down for an outage as an example, the cameras continue to record events onto the SD card. Once wifi returns you can see the event history and see what you missed.4: there customer service seems to be great they have responded to several of my inquiries in under 24 hrs.Things that can be improved:1: Give users an Event download option in the app straight to your mobile device. (The app has an option to record a clip similar to iPhones screen record in order to save the clip but no real toggle to download the entire event)2: I believe these cameras record under 30 FPS so video is not ultra smooth. The pan and tilt cameras look like they might be recording at 15-23 frames per second3: I would like a visual or option in the app that shows me at what Quality the clips are stored to the SD card. In the app the app when doing live stream you have a standard and Full HD toggle for quality. The big question is at why native quality is it recording to the SD. Giving the user a visual or option to control this ensures we are getting maximum 2K quality in our clips.4: I have notices that this system when it begins to record is a few seconds after the fact there has been motion. Other camera systems provide you with 1-3 seconds of video right before the motion takes place giving you more to the story of the incident. I have noticed this is 1-3 seconds late in capturing the full clip.
