Â I modified mine. This is my second one, I am in and out of the truck several times a day all day and sometimes all night. I removed the adhesive and added a washer under the lever to draw the diaphragm in more, so that the suction cup is strong enough to hold it to the windshield without the adhesive. I need to be able to switch trucks fast on occasion so the adhesive is a pain. I also had to cut down the ridges that help lock the lever in place so the washer would sit flat.
