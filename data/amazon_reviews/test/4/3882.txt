If it weren't for the lighting quality issues, I would seriously say this was a perfect purchase! The color is super cute, all the accessories were great (especially the fish eye lens, which I used for wider shots). They're soooo easy to use and print super fast! Unfortunately we had a brightly lit hall on a cloudy day and the lighting just did not work so for its first use, many pictures came out too dark even after going though the different brightness settings. Excited to try again and hope for better pictures!
