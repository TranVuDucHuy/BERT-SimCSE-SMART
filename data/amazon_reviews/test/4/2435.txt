I've bought this product several times over the past couple of years. It has been great and worked really well for my needs until recently. I must have gotten a faulty pack cause every photo I took was ruined. There was ink leaking and to prevent it from ruining my whole camera, I had to take the pack out early, wasting 5 pieces of film. Besides this one incident, I really have had good luck with this product. I would've returned the pack, but I bought it a month in advanced for a party and the return window closed. I would suggest using it shortly after it arrives and making sure it works and there's no nicks in the film. If it is faulty, return it asap. Other than that, great product with quality results. I will still order from this company unless the packs continue to become faulty. I will update my review if that happens.UPDATE: Bought more film after this review and it left weird purple swirls on the film. There were pressure swirls on the back of the film that I believe caused this. Only took 2 photos, returning the film.UPDATE: So as it turns out, my camera has been having issues lately and it was the reason my photos were ending up with people swirls. The pack where there was leakage was defective, but the others were not.
