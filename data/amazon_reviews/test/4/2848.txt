These ear buds sound great and have a good battery life. The noise canceling is nice but not a feature I use much. I use these to listen to music and audio books. The only time I have an issue is when they shift in my ear and the sound drops off then comes back. That's the only reason for 4 stars. If I needed another pair of ear buds I would probably buy the same ones.
