Great concept. Liked the idea of wraping cord around the power strip, for travel, very portable.Would fit nicely in travel bag, without bulkiness of a regular power strip. Perfect size power strip to put on night stand when traveling. I do think the cord was too short for use in some hotel rooms, if outlet wasn't close to nightstand.
