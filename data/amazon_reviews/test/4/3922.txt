Few things right off the bat.First off whatever angle you had it set to it doesn't hold that angle very well, I'm not sure if it's because of the foam or because of the plastic screws just don't tighten very well, but over time the phone will start to turn and slip out of whatever adjustment you have it set to.Second, if you have side buttons on your phone, learn how to turn off the gestures. Otherwise you'll be taking random photos. But that's not why I rated it down, I rated it down to four stores because of the lack of holding the setting you angled the phone mount atThird, it's very difficult to get the eye piece of the telescope to mount to the mount piece of this mount. I understand why they used foam to not scratch the eyepiece, but the phone doesn't contour evenly so sometimes you get weird angles looking into the eyepiece, causing the image to be distorted a bit.
