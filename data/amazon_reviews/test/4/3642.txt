Always thought a wireless connection would be great and it is. Unfortunately, the band I was in broke up before I got to use them at a gig but it's still fun playing at home and not being tied to the amp. My only complaint is that when the battery goes, it goes without warning and suddenly you have no sound. It would be nice if the sound deteriorated audibly enough to know when it was about to die. Overall though they perform well and at the price, they are great.
