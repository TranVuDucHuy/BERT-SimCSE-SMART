The product is great. The materials to install the protectors are good. I found the "hinge strips" not needed and when I tried to use them had issues with them not sticking to the phone very well. The cleaning wipe, cloth and dust strips worked well and for the Iphone 8 that I was fitting, I could position the screen well without the "hinge strips". Fumbling with the strips caused a dust issue that required me to start over with the install.
