Not bad, easy to setup in app on phones, or using the reolink desktop computer software. however, the only regret I have is not buying a bigger one that is able to use more storage. The storage on this ships with 2TB, and is only upgradable to 6TB. No idea why.. it makes no sense.. I can throw any capacity storage drive in a computer, but not an NVR? What is limiting it? It has to be firmware from Reolink.. this needs to be adjusted as 2TB is not enough, and 6TB may not even be enough. It's 2022 and we are limited to low storage amounts. Makes no sense to me from a tech perspective. A 6TB surveillance drive upgrade will cost you another $135 or more.With 2TB included storage, and only 4 x 4K cameras going, I can only hold 7 days of video feed. Meaning it will hold 21 days of video feed when I get done adding the 6TB drive upgrade. But I have 2 more cameras to be installed, and possibly 2 more down the line making it 8 total cameras on the 8 channel NVR. That being said, if we average it per camera, adding 2 more cameras for a total of 6, will leave me with about 5.25 days of video feed.. making it 8 will save about 3.5 days of video feed. Increasing the storage to 6TB will make it 15.75 days and 10.5 days respectively. This is crazy low compared to other system out there.
