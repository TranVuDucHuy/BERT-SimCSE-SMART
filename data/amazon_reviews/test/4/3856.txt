Is was fine until it wasnâ€™t. Only got 5 months use out of it and now when I turn it on it just flashes on and then immediately turns off.UPDATE: seller contacted me and offered to replace the light. I received the new one within a few days and so far it works great. Seller was very pleasant and responsive. Did not ask me to change my rating.
