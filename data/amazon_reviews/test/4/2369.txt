It charges my iPhones 12/13, as an uber driver I got my iphone on it all day, but after a few hours it gets hot to the touch so as the iPhone so I got the message “Charging On Hold Charging will resume when iPhone returns to normal temperature.” Other than that everything is okUpdate: on my way to work today I smelled something weird and I found out it was the usb-c connection, so I unplugged right away, I didn’t even had the phone on it, so I guess it will work only from now on as a phone holder only
