Update:After posting this review, we were contacted by the manufacturer and they offered to replace the projector for free. It took only 3 days from shipping it back to receiving a new replacement. The new one is currently working. I will update this if it messes up again, but customer service has been good to make this up! Contact them if yours stops miracastingPrevious review:Used this product less than 7 weeks for a total of 5 hours. Miracast stopped working. Tried to contact multiple times the seller. Each time tells me he is sending me a firmware update, never sends it. Been two weeks. Such a bummer.
