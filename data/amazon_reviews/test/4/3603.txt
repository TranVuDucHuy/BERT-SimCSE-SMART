I've been looking for a set of headphones that worked well during a vigorous workout on a rowing machine, and these fit the bill perfectly. They're very lightweight, and the fit is excellent. I really hadn't thought about the noise cancellation, but it turns out they do a great job in that regard as well, I'm not sure that they're quite up to Apple's level in that department, but the price difference offers them a bit of leeway. The charging case is tiny, but I could have wished for one that was thinner (if longer and wider); this one is like a little rock in my pocket. That said, they change the EarPods quickly and have plenty of battery life on a single charge.
