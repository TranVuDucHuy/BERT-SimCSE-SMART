Let me tell you for the price this light is pretty dynamic you can change the color temperature and also the brightness pretty easily and for such a small light it's very bright and I've found this light to be reliable and it does hold a charge for up to realistically 3 hours which is pretty good and it's easy to recharge I highly recommend this light for any film or video person that's looking to get a small light for run and gun filming. also very lightweight... And can do different color ranges..Good little light I highly recommend it..
