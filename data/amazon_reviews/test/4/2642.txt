It was very easy to assemble and use. the app that it comes with works pretty well but I did have an issue with the cameras on my iphone 13 max not lining up with the phone mount so i have to use an old phone but it still works.The other biggest problem ive found is the locks slipping when trying to line something up, ive found i need to line the star up below my FOV just for it to fall back down into place when I engage the lock. Im not sure how common this is with telescopes as this is my first one ive owned and have only ever used the ones at my school.Overall im happy with the purchase but will likely need to look into a new solution for the mount and tripod part.
