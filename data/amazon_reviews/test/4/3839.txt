I purchased this about two months ago. I own two other high end film scanners that I use to get quality scans of some of my slides for various projects. I have always wanted to scan all of my slides and negatives, but the scanners I own take two (2) to four (4) minutes to scan each slide, in addition to the time it takes to clean the slides prior to scanning. This scanner takes about four (4) seconds per scan. I read a lot of the reviews about this scanner with interest. I was concerned with reviews expressing concerns about:1) Image quality.2) Ease of use.I decided I would try this scanner and in the worst case scenario it would let me quickly see the approximately 4000 slides in my collection that I have not seen in 40 plus years and allow me to determine which of my slides I would need to re-scan with one of my high end scanners if any.This review only address how this scanner handles slides. The one thing I liked most about it is that the lens in the camera offers a good depth of field and the images are sharp corner to corner even if the film is warped. If your slides are well exposed it produces good scans and the scanner allows coarse exposure and color corrections for poorly exposed slides. Many reviewers complained that these adjustments were too coarse, I found that they allowed rough corrections for old faded and discolored film which makes further adjustments in software editing packages easier. I found that I was able to scan most rolls of film without tinkering with these adjustments once I had corrected my first slide on that roll of film. You will need a can of compressed air or a little blower to keep the flat light source free of dust which if not cleaned will make spots on your scans. An anti-static brush is also helpful.Below I will address the three areas of concerns I was worried about:1) Image quality.The one area that I wish Kodak would change is the file compression setting that the scanner uses on itâ€™s files. This unit uses a 14 mega-pixel camera with the option to up sample to 22 MB Using the 14 MB setting the image files are only about 1.5 MB, using the 22 MB setting produces files about 4.3 MB. This indicates a very high degree of compression! I wish they offered options to adjust it. This is too much compression! I was fairly certain that my images would need some post-scan color correction. After a short period of testing I felt I saw a slight improvement in image quality from the 22 MB images vs the 14 MB images after post-scan color correction. I set the unit to the 22MB setting and I have ran all of my files through a batch file color correction in Photoshop Elements. To get files from this scanner to approach the output from my high end scanners I have to spend time in Photoshop manually correcting the output from this scanner. But 4 minutes vs 4 seconds and in the end I will most likely only need to re-scan maybe 1% to 2% of my slides, so yes this scanner offers a lot of bang for the buck!2) Ease of use.It comes with two slide adapters. One for thick plastic mounts and one for the thin cardboard mounts. Both of these adapters are designed so you can quickly push the slides through the scanner. I used the adapter for the thick on just a few of my slides, it work good for plastic mounted slides. The adapter for the thin cardboard mounts has a problem in that if the slide mounts are bent they will catch on the plastic frame on the discharge side of the slide exposure opening where the light passes through the slides so they can be scanned. To fix this I took a small jewelers file and tapered the top and bottom edges of the plastic frame on that side of adapter enabling me to push many of my bent slides through the adapter without catching. I had to bevel a little less than 1/16" of the plastic to get it to work and I still had a just few slides that hung up on this edge. However it is fairly easy to slide the adapter out of the scanner and then push the offending slide mount up or down while pushing the next side into the adapter which will push the offending slide past the catch point. Once the offending slide is no longer caught on the frame you can re-insert the adapter into the scanner and finish pushing your slides through the scanner. Thankfully the adapter is plastic and filing it down was easy.
