Overall this is a good camera for the price but if you are looking for a higher quality system with more functions (and more expensive) maybe look elsewhere. See explanation below:Video Storage Isn't Free:I bought this camera originally to monitor my pet while at work but didn't have the record and save video set up so it was free. I decided to get a couple more cameras to put around the house and got external memory cards to record footage while away. When I found out that you have to pay a monthly fee for each camera to record and store the footage I was a little disappointed. This was disappointing because it wasn't indicated anywhere that you needed a subscription to save the footage, only to purchase a microSD card that wasn't included already included. So why am I paying to record footage on a microSD card I bought? It is only ~$2 a month subscription fee per camera but the description is misleading.Video Quality:As far as recorded footage, the quality is great! You can even place these inside and have them face through a window and will still get a good quality video as long as the window isn't dirty and the sun isn't shining directly on the camera. The camera has a wide view and the night vision is spectacular. Definitely beat my expectations as far as video quality.Motion Detection/AI:The motion detection/IA is a little funky as far as detecting people/vehicles/complete motion, etc. I had to mess around with the motion detection distance to get it right and use the function to block off certain sections of the video from detecting motion. Blocking off certain sections worked okay except for when the trees were blowing around in the wind. I had to block off pretty much the entire field of view to prevent the trees from setting the motion detection off but then it wasn't detecting anything at all. So if you have a lot of trees and wind, be prepared for dozens of motion detection alerts a day.
