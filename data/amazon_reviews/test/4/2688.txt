I like the simplicity of this device, but it does have a serious flaw if you are using it on a Macbook like most of us will be. Let's start with the good: the attachment to your phone is great, if you have a Magsafe compatible iPhone model. The not-great part is that the clamps that form the screen mount are very wide compared to the thin screen of the Macbook Air, so it just kind of loosely sits on top rather than gripping the screen. The weight of the phone ends up tilting it backwards, and the resulting picture has way more headroom than your built-in Macbook camera.Anyway, there's a simple fix. If you pad the screen mount just slightly as I show in the pictures, it has an appropriately tight grip on the screen and the phone will stay at the intended angle, straight forward like the Macbook's original camera. I used 1-sided mounting tape for this.
