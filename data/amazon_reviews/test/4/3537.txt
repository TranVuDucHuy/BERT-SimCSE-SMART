I installed this in my 2023 Corvette. I have a few cars and have been using the magnetic holders that clip in to the cars ac/heating vents. Though not perfect they work pretty well and I use them in all my cars. The vents in this car are not compatible with the magnetic holder. I gave this cup holder thing a try. I don't like giving up a cup holder spot in this car but it's the only real alternative I had.This holder fits well and is sturdy. My iPhone 6S (yes I know it's old but I don't beleive in updating things for the sake of updating with no improvement for my purposes) in it's case fits well. The holders phone release works well. The space for the charging cord is positioned well. The downside. The grip on the phone could be better. If the holder is not angled back to an almost flat position the phone tends to slip out of the holder. The case is not bulky at all and is very slim. Maybe a bulkier case would hold better. I solved this by wrapping a rubber band around each of the gripping sides and it works to keep the phone in place. Should you have to do this to an item you bought for this simple function-NO. This should have been taken into account in the design process. Not a difficult fix. I gave it 4 stars because overall the product is good. And I was able to solve this issue at no cost as I have no shortage of rubber bands lying around. Maybe I should have rated it a 1 or a 2 because it does not do well the 1 thing it's designed to do. But, the issue was easily fixable. That's my 2 cents worth.
