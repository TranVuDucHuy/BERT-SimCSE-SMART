I watched a lot of reviews when I was deciding on purchasing this so I was aware of the shortcomings. Yes, it heats up quickly and yes it has a short battery life. But the size and convenience of it was my motivation.The base is small enough that you can keep it on you wherever you go. If you take several minute recordings at a time during your event, the battery won't get so hit so quickly. That also makes it easier to to put together in post production because you can find clips faster than going thru one big clip to find a section. When I'm on a bicycle or motorcycle ride, I know people don't want to see every inch of the ride. They want to see the interesting parts and that's what this camera allows. It's easy to turn on and off quickly.This is an action cam that's small enough to get interesting shots in all kinds of weird places using short clips that are easily stitched together. The size limits the battery life and probably heat dissipation. If it could be made slightly larger I'd like a USB C port or micro USB card built in. Otherwise I'm having a fun time with this and it meets my expectations after I thoroughly looked into it.
