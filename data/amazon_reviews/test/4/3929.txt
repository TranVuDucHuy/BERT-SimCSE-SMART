Needed a decent lightweight point-and-shoot for my backcountry ski guide business to take photos of clients in action (and to document any anomalies that might come along). Because of the harsh conditions of cold and snow, didn't want to invest in something too big or expensive - I accidentally dropped my previous PixPro in a crevasse at the end of last season, it's gone forever, but was still working ok after two seasons and hundreds, if not thousands, of photos. Anyway, I just bought a new one - I like the price and the fact that it uses AA batteries. I can be out for a week or more and just carry two extra batteries, easy peasy. The key to this camera is to get the best batteries available - I use Energizer lithium brand, not cheap but they last far, far longer in the PixPro than anything else I've found and are not affected by cold. The quality of the photos is good enough for my uses, which is basically something clients can post to their social media accounts and email to friends. Be sure to adjust the settings for your needs, otherwise the camera goes to a default setting. Delivery was quick.
