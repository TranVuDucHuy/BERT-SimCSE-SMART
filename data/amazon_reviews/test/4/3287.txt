I love SmallRig products. My whole rig for my BMPCC 6K is SmallRig products. They are super well crafted and super thoughtfully designed for the needs of filmmaking. They're affordable, too, which is important for those of us doing this for mostly hobby work. This matte box is superb. It's light but pretty durable with nice hefty hardware. Does exactly what it says it should.My one problem, and this is a general one for all of SmallRig's gear, is that absolutely no instructions come with any of their products, and very few even have so much as an explainer video on YouTube about how to set things up. And the descriptions on their website and Amazon are usually pretty bare bones, with little help in knowing what will and won't fit on the particular rig you have. Because of that, I'm constantly having to send items back, order new items compatible with my particular rig, and then waiting while all those false starts happen. I think the company just assumes you're an industry professional who just magically knows to check, for example, your lens diameter (the ones that come with the matte box don't fit my smaller photo lenses; I think they assume you've got cine lenses for this) or that the cage for the battery pack and BMPCC isn't compatible with a normal baseplate, etc. I know there are a lot of different cameras they're trying to fit things to, but giving some better direction would save me having to get frustrated about how to order parts, connect things, and operate the gear. If that were to change, this would easily be a 5-star review.
