Yes this is expensive, but I ended up purchasing 3 total of these because they work. I first tried 3rd party options and they are questionable. The reason i say this is because 3rd party versions provide 5v via USB-A. I get spotty charging on 3rd party. These Arlo outdoor are 9v wired directly to the plug, which is needed for proper charging and uninterupted power. Constant motion, recording, and spotlight (or floodlight for that model) can cause charging issues with 5v. This is how the spotlight knows if your using a non official plug and goes i to charge only mode. When it gets the 9v it increases brightness on the spotlight and allows you to use charge whileoperating. Do your self a favor and get a reliable factory cable. At least until a 3rd party manufacturer can at least match the proper 9v power requirements for the unit they use. (They use 5v because it's cheap to get 5v plug-ins and use a usb cable with proprietary connectors.) Hopefully this will help someone know why not to go 3rd party based on user experiences alone.
