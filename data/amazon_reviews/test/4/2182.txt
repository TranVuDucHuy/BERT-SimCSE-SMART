I bought these with the sole intention of using them to listen to a show/music while going to sleep, and they work GREAT for that. They are super comfortable, I wear mine like a headband. I have a big head, and they still fit really nice.I would not say the sound quality is great, after all they are >$20 headphones. But they are good enough!I gave 1 star on noise cancellation - I dont think these do any noise cancelation at all, the only noise canceling that would happen is from your ears being covered - on that note, they do OK.Battery life seems very impressive.All and all, for what I wanted them for, they are great!
