I purchased this as a “second” camera because I wanted a really good zoom, and my other camera (while it takes amazing pictures) doesn’t have much of a zoom. Well the zoom on this Canon doesn’t disappoint.Pros:• 40X Zoom is AWESOME and is really the reason to buy this camera.• This camera is more user-friendly than my Panasonic, for ameteurs like me.• Picture quality is very good. You can get some really clear, sharp pictures.• Auto mode is good and makes it easy to use for general pictures.• The auto focus is good for zoom pictures and landscape pictures.• Camera is light and easy to carry.• I thought the battery life was good. I took pictures all day, and spent (cumulative) at least an hour scrolling thru the menus trying to figure out the settings – and the battery lasted almost all day.• Love the grip on this camera. Feels really good in your hand.Cons:• NO USER MANUAL comes with this camera, which is just baffling to me. You get a manual if you buy a blender or a waffle iron, but Canon can’t include the manual with the camera?! What is up with that?!• Poor Image Stabilizer. My hands are rather shaky, and this camera acts like it doesn’t have stabilization at all. It’s especially noticeable when your taking zoom pictures.• Not so easy to connect to the iPhone via Wi-Fi. I actually had to look up a how-to instructional on YouTube.• Not so easy to figure out how to manually change the aperture and shutter speeds. So I mostly stick to Auto mode.• The auto focus is good on landscapes, portraits and the zoom – not so good on the macro. I was trying to take close ups of bugs and never could get it to focus on the right spot.• Macro function is lackluster – but again, you don’t really buy this camera for the macro, you buy it for the zoom.Bottom line: good all around, general use, camera. Would be the perfect camera for an amateur looking for something a step up from their iPhone, that’s easy to use. This camera definitely has some flaws that need to be addressed. But in the end, you buy it for the zoom, and the zoom is awesome.
