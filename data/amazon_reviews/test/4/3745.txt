My wife and I use this to stream things (only at night, has to be dark) each evening, partly because our living room doesn't have a good place for a TV and this is easier than carrying in a TV and stand, and we use a screen that's larger than our TV. We stream through a Roku that plugs into the projector via HDMI cable, as you'd expect. It was easy to connect with a Bluetooth speaker, but the sound is pretty good from the projector itself (better than our previous one, which I dropped and broke). I'm sure that more costly projectors would have somewhat better definition and brightness, but this meets our needs well. There are just 2 annoyances: (1) somehow a tiny spec of, presumably, dust got behind the lens (not the front, where I could remove it) and appears constantly -- my wife didn't even notice it, but my eye keeps going there -- I imagine this can happen with any projector, and there certainly is no way for a consumer to disassemble and reassemble); (2) Although it's possible to reduce the projection size by 25%, I wish it were 50%, which would allow us to put the projector and screen on different ends of our living room., so we wouldn't need to be careful not to trip over them. (The screen, as I recall, is 60" diagonally. We have our projector on a tripod-type stand.) At this price, very good value.
