This is an excellent compact general purpose lens for use on Sony cameras.1. Construction is mostly plastic but well made and feels very solid. Lens mount is metal.2. This is a fast f/2.8 lens at the wide end (28 mm) and a reasonable f/5.6 at the long end (200 mm).3. Fast autofocus.4. Image quality is excellent throughout the range.5. Weather sealed so can be taken out in inclement weather.6. No image stabilisation as it depends on the camera's IBIS.7. Includes a hood but no case.8. Lighter than the equivalent Sony lens.Pros:1. Compact, light and well made lens.2. Faster than the competition.3. Excellent image quality throughout the zoom range.4. Good weather sealing.Cons:1. 28 mm wide angle rather than the more typical 24 mm seen in the Sony.2. Has no built in optical stabilization and relies on the camera for image stabilization which is not always the most optimum solution (having both helps performance).Summary: Thoroughly recommended.Note: When I purchased this lens from Amazon I did not get a US warranty from Tamron and it appears to be a gray market product. I did not find this out until I tried to register the lens with Tamron which indicated that it was not a US market version. Check the supplier before you buy. Look for the Tamron 6 Year US warranty.
