Bought it, spent a week evaluating it, and returned it.For about 3 years I've used a pair of Canon HD cameras, the SX 710 HS (pocket camera with 30X optical zoom) and the SX 60 HS Powershot Bridge camera (65X Optical zoom, resembles a small DSLR). I bought the SX 710 to be a complete replacement for a much earlier Canon slightly smaller in size to the SX 60. I learned quickly that the LCD screen on the 710 gets washed out in sunlight and can't be tilted. It's very useful for much of my needs and the pocket size is convenient. But it can't be counted on during daylight, so I bought the SX 60. I never thought I'd need two cameras but I'm very happy toting both when needed using each camera where it works best.I say all this only to explain my environment as I began looking into upgrading to 4k video and photo technology. I’m very much a point and shooter generally using everything set to automatic. The Canons I own now and whatever I purchase will provide much more technology and capability that I will ever use.As I got familiar with what's available today my desirable features became1.) 4K video/photo technology2.) better image stabilization although my Canons are very good at that3.) 1.0 image sensor to get more detail and better low light results4.) and at least 15X Optical Zoom (for my purposes anything over about 12X optical generates nothing more than bragging rights!).Now, on to the HC-WXF991K. I rated the camera overall higher than my comment would suggest. That probably is fair as some of what made me return it had to with personal preference as opposed to product deficiencies. Here we go:1. The owner’s manual drones on about the dangers of leaving the battery installed when the camera is not in use indicating that there is always a minimal battery drain that could result in permanent damage to the battery. I don’t know if there is anything unique about this camera that warrants the ominous warnings, and I get not leaving a battery in a camera long term unattended. But the way it was worded made me wonder if I should remove the battery when walking away from the camera overnight. If that’s the case then Panasonic needs to resolve that.2. The camera has two low light technologies: Very Low Light and Infrared. Very Low Light mode produces a noticeably brighter image on the LCD and might be useable to take photos without a flash where one would expect to use a flash. But when taking movies in Very Low Light mode it produces movies with most of the frames missing creating very jerky (unuseable) movies. The owner’s manual describes this as missing a few frames, but that’s a great understatement. Infrared turns the image green as you would expect. But part of the lens hood is directly in front of the infrared lamp preventing the lamp from reaching part of what the camera can see. The resultant shadow is very obvious in the infrared image on the LCD screen.3. The video light comes on as the ambient light gets lower REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ACTUALLY RECORDING A VIDEO. Being behind the camera you may not know that it’s on wasting battery charge and irritating people in front of it. The video light can be set to ON/AUTO/OFF but that setting is not user friendly. First if you use the camera in Auto mode, as I would most of the time, the video light is forced to AUTO and can’t be changed! Second, the Owner’s Manual leads you through the menu screens to where this setting is SUPPOSED TO BE, but it isn’t there. I did stumble onto it while rummaging around through the menu structure, but it was nowhere near where the Manual sent me. I suspect this is a case of the manual not keeping up with changes made to the logic inside the camera.4. I frequently use my SX 60 HS while walking holding it in front of me about belly button height with the LCD screen angled to avoid direct sunlight. When I try this with the HC-WXF991K I find that the wrist strap can’t be used because of the wrist angle that would be required if you held the camera as I just described. So I cradle the camera in my right hand, hold the LCD in my left hand to offer some stability. With my hands in these positions the record start stop button is impossible to reach. To me this says that I’m just not suited for a camera in a camcorder configuration as the record button is correctly positioned with the wrist strap in use and the camcorder held up to the eye. So this is a personal preference issue and not a product deficiency issue. Nonetheless, it’s part of the reason I returned the item.5. The rotatable side camera built into the LCD screen was supposed to be a big plus for this camera. I envisioned being able to take candid photos or movies of people next to me. The amount of screen space on the LCD (and thus the recorded PIP video) can be set to two sizes…very small and very, very small. You can’t make the side camera image the main image on the screen, and you have no zoom in/out capability with it. When the side camera is pointed at the camera operator the camera needs to be held well forward of the operator (uncomfortably so) in order to get his entire face into the side camera image (no zoom out). When the side camera is pointed at the person next to you the camera needs to be move so close to that person as to invade his/her personal space (no zoom in). I’d suggest that if this is an important feature to prospective buyers they should experience the usability before buying, or at least be prepared to be disappointed. For my purposes the side camera added no value.Along the way in making the purchase/return decisions I stumbled onto a YouTube video that was making the point that you probably can’t tell the difference between 1080P and 4K videos by watching them. The viewer didn’t know until later that pieces of the introduction to that video were shot in intermingled segments recorded at 1080P. 4K, and even 720P resolution. Armed with that knowledge the intro was replayed and the speaker identified which pieces were recorded at which resolution. I still couldn’t tell the difference! I’ll tell you that I watch football game replays using NFL GAMEPASS on a 75” television that is 4K capable. GAMEPASS streams games at 720P resolution. Those games to my eye look as good as the original HD broadcasts.You may THINK you can tell the difference by looking… and maybe you can. In my case the value of 4K recording is that I can crop down to maybe 20% of a 4K video, zoom in to blow that crop up to full screen. That crop will have enough pixels to approach HD resolution.Considering the downers noted above, and what little the HC-WXF991K added to my movie/photo tool bag, I felt that the $800 price tag was just too high to justify keeping it. Having returned it I bought the Panasonic Lumix DC-ZS200 which I am currently evaluating. It is more or less pocket size but slightly larger than the Canon SX 710 HS I’ve been using. What it offers over the SX 710 HS is: 4K resolution, TOUCH LCD screen, Electronic View Finder, much larger image sensor, better stabilization. At $700 it’s pricey and lacks some of the features of the HC-WXF991K that I probably would find useful. But if it survives my evaluation I don’t mind paying for what I get. And with the EVF included I may be back to one camera. We’ll see.
