Was trying to replace 2 old Arlo cameras I have. Got great deal on a 5 pack and the video quality is good but I dislike the range that triggers the camera to come on. Movement has to be closer than the Arlo cameras. The videos are all short clips as well which means I have multiple clips instead of 1 long one. I also had trouble with blocking out areas to block the trigger. Movement in those areas still triggered the camera to record.I liked how easy it is to turn them on and off for alerts but was disappointed that the cameras didn't record activity anyway. I had planned to turn off the alerts while home so my phone didn't disturb me but still wanted to have videos recorded in case of activity I needed to review.I didn't get the plan but used a thumb drive to back up my videos to the synch module instead. It worked great but did take a few seconds longer to view.Overall a good camera system and cost was very reasonable but definitely a budget brand camera system.
