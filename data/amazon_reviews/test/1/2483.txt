I have purchased these multiple times and for the money you can't beat them. They work very well and I have had no issues connecting them to various devices. I wish they had some additional controls on the buds themselves to advance music or pause etc but it's not that big of a deal. The customer service is also great . The first pair I ordered almost a year ago had some weird issue.... APEKX customer service promptly replaced them under warranty without any problem. At this time, I highly recommend these earbuds!** UPDATED September 21, 2022 **I am revising my review of these headphones. Since the original pair, I have ordered 3 additional pairs (4 total) and all but one pair has stopped working at least in one earbud. I contacted customer service again thinking they would be helpful like last time and they were completely unhelpful. I explained the situation... one earbud in two pairs stopped working and would not charge at all or power on at all. I took pictures of them in the charger plugged in, I took pictures of the charger itself, I took pictures of the earbuds closeup, the charger close up etc.. and sent them all to the customer support email as requested.They replied back and said I would need to send the broken earbuds to some warehouse address in Canada! I would need to pay the return shipping and deal with all the paperwork etc. This is completely unacceptable to me. We are talking about shipping to Canada from the US and paying all the postage on an item that was ~$25 to start. I asked about a shipping label and heard nothing back. I emailed asking why this was different than last time when they handled sending out a new pair once I provided images and a description of the issue.I can't believe I spent this much time writing a review but I feel there are better vendors out there with affordable Bluetooth earbuds. One pair breaking I would understand but 3 out of 4 is not good. Add on the poor customer service and I can no longer recommend these.
