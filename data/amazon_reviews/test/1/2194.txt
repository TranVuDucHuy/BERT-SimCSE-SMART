The TC-777 from Tonor is an absolutely appalling product. I am absolutely shocked that something this bad can make it to production. This mic has no gain control, and no software to support it. They recommend you download Audacity and edit your voice files from there, which in theory would work just fine but the quality of sound that this mic produces is embarrassing. If you’re doing voice work for YouTube this mic is nearly unusable. No gain control means you’ll have to turn the mic’s volume down to near 60% to avoid background hiss and then normalize your voice files, after which you’ll get a sound comparable to talking through tin can in a tunnel after you’ve just gotten over a bout of pneumonia. Also, to make this all worse, no two voice files sound the same! You’ll get some that sound barely passable, followed by four that either can’t be heard or that are so loud that you’ll wish you were hard of hearing. I wouldn’t even use this for beginner streaming or gaming. Don’t pay attention to the pleasant reviews on this page, do yourself a favor and save up for a Yeti Blue Nano. As with a lot of things in life, you have to pay to play, and that is surely the case with the search for decent audio.
