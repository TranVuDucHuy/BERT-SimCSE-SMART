Bought it a couple months before a planned trip. Didn't test if it was recognizable by my cell phone. Took the overseas trip and was very puzzled at its usefulness since it did not pair with my cell phone. Followed the suggested procedure to a T and tried again. Failed again. After the trip, couldn't locate it for some time and, when I finally found it, the product return window was already closed. Guess I can still it as a tripod stand to hold the phone etc. but the intended function of snapping a photo is absent.
