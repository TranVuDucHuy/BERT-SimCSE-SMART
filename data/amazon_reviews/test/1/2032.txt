I have a Toyota Highlander SUV, not old but not new either. I like Lamicall brand & assumed with the double vent clips I would get double protection (recently got gifted a iPhone 13 Pro Max) I clipped it on, using and following the pictures/instructions provided... and the top vent broke! So I thought I was doing something wrong (right it must be me?) So I was much more careful the second time and VERY gentle and it happened AGAIN. I had bought another brand with just ONE vent clip and it worked no problem.So I guess I did not realized or it did not occur to me that 2 vent clips- even though the iPhone 13 pro max (with otter case) is pretty heavy in weight, it does hold no problem with ONE vent clip. And if you attempt to use 2 vent clips this MIGHT happen because cars sometimes are made cheaply. Just be aware. Guess there is not chance of Lamicall trying to contact me and making this right??? One can hope.
