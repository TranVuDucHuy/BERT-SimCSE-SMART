In between placing my order and checking out the product became unavailable from Amazon. But another vendor, Printer Supply Solutions, was recommended. It wasn't Prime but there was free shipping and a couple bucks cheaper. So I ordered it through them.Advertised is a new ink cartridge in Epson retail packaging. But I received used, refilled cartridges, shipped loose in an envelope, not in retail packaging. Not sealed in an epson plastic vacuum formed bag. Just a thin plastic bag with air in it. The peel off stickers were hot-glued on!! Well, one of them was. One had fallen off. It is such an obvious scam. Refills when you pay for new!!! And, Refilled very poorly.Epson states it is a warranty violation to use these cartridges. As such, they are not usable.Vendor was courteous, stated that they remove the epson packaging to save on shipping costs and were prompt in refunding monies. They didn't want the refills back. The cartridges went right in the trash. Not taking risk of ruining my printer.Sorry could not give lower than a one star.Had ordered these before (non refills) and those worked fine.
