I purchased a new printer in December 2021. It came with ink so I came to Amazon and the Brother store within and bought these XL cartridges. I knew the small capacity cartriges would not last long. Not only did I purchase these and the Black XL, I put them on auto ship through Subscribe & Save. That brings me to today, four months later, needing to replace all three colors. I put them in, printed 10 sheets and one is out of ink and the other too are too low to print! What?! Of course because I purchase these four months ago I am outside the return/exchange window. This was my first and last time ordering Brother ink. RIP OFF!
