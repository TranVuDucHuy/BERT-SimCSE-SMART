Terrible quality earbuds. Not sure where all these positive reviews come from. Maybe people do not wait long enough before they provide their reviews.After some time of usage the left earbud's sound level just goes down and there is nothing you can do to make it louder. I've read for some people it was the right one but for me it was the left. Twice! It happened with the first pair I got and since it was within the Amazon return window, I exchanged them for a new pair (should've just returned them). Same thing happened with the second pair but the return window is closed now.Another problem -- many times when answering a phone call the sound would start moving from one side to another. Not sure how else to describe it, it's just the sound just moves from one earbud to another.Long story short, these are very bad quality earbuds. They will last for a short while but then will have problems.
