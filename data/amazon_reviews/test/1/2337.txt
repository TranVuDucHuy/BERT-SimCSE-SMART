THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS INCORRECT AND MISLEADING. The item is advertised as a "2 pack" of toner cartridges. The image of the product states "2 pack" and two toner cartridges are pictures, but I only received one. I contacted Amazon customer service after 30 minutes of winding through the online help only to Google their phone number because I couldn't find it on the Amazon website. The customer service agent told me that I only ordered one instead of two despite the way the product was posted. Very poor customer service.
