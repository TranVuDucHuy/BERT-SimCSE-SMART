I did a lot of research on cell phone holders since my old one broke. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to find it anywhere so I tried this one. It did not hold my phone 99 percent of the time. Luckily it didn’t crack but could have easily shattered my phone. The piece that connects to the vent was really awkward and hard to cram into the vent. This is not functional at all. I returned it.
