Received my Rode Wireless this evening. Something was wrong with it. First, the Rode box (not the amazon box) was wet. Still opened it to check the Mic in it. Several scratches on the screen of the transmitter and the faces of all transmitter and receivers. It looked like a product that was refurbished after some use, instead of a brand new one. The cover face of the transmitter was even getting off, revealing the circuitry on the inside. With the box being wet, I will not even try to turn it on and I risk having water/humidity damages in the inside now or soon. I requested a refund (could not ask for an exchange apparently) and ordered a new one. For the $$ price of it, I will not keep a refurbished one with damagesWill update this review once I receive the new one
