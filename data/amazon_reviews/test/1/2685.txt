when I got the zipper on the case was unzipped. I though things happen but when I plugged the microphone into my iPhone it did not work. There was no owners manual so I went to Movo website & still could not find a owners manual or anything on how to use the microphone. So I sent Movo an e-mail thru their website and waited a few hours and nothing. So I contacted Amazon support and they tried to help me but could not find any information on the equipment either? So I finally gave up and asked for a refund. Then on top of this all later that evening I get a e-mail from Movo saying "we noticed you looked on our website but did not buy anything would you like help buying something" How crazy is that?
