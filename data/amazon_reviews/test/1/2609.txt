I’ve only had it for two weeks. I fully charged it and in the middle of singing the sound went mute but was still powered on because the lights were still on, Bluetooth said connected. Then the sound was just static and buzzing. I powered it off and took out the battery. Turned on and you can here whatever you’re playing but after a few seconds it static’s/buzz and mutes again. Sometimes you can hear the music at the start but once you start to sing into the mic then you’re not able to hear yourself anymore. It worked great the first two weeks with no issues but after that it went fownhill. Don’t waste your money!
