I laminate all the time, I read the bad reviews and seeing the tempting price just hoped the reviews were all due to user error or knit picky people. This product is only well suited to laminating full sized sheets of paper or on thing at a time. There is no cling factor at all once you lift to put items into the laminator they will move around and slide. These sheets have also gotten stuck, and rolled up in my laminator that I have otherwise used without issue for 6 years . I am not a regular review writer but these are very frustrating to use. Don’t be me, don’t be tempted just buy more expensive unless you are just protecting full size documents they would be fine for that.
