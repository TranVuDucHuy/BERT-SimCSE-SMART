These were decent to start with for the price point, but after 4 months use they started acting up. They would connect when they were closed in the case and now one of them won't charge at all, even though the case is fully charged. I have made sure to clean the metal connect points but it doesn't matter. So it's only working halfway which is useless for me. Be warned they won't last long.
