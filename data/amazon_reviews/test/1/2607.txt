There's not enough volume for a small club house. I could talk louder than the microphone, in my regular loud voice, not yelling. Keep your money on this one. I only had occasion to use it twice. Last night at our clubhouse condo board meeting, it was useless. Absolutely useless. I hate I bought this brand, I thought the case it came in was cute. Very disappointed and it appears that I have had it too long to return it.
