Really disappointed by these. I don't think the product reviews or description accurately reflect the product I received. My main issues are1) the weight. So light weight (and kinky from the packaging) that they catch on everything, won't stay put, and don't offer resistance to the body to keep the buds in ear.2) there is no fit bead to tighten the loose, light wires below the chin. This is my bad for not noticing that before I bought it.3) sound quality is just awful. Worse than the broken headphones that I replaced with these. If you move slightly the sound switches between ears and will do both or only one. The constant shifting is so distracting. Entirely impractical unless you are using them in a still position.4) I've bought headphones in tight packaging before and even though the cord was wrapped tightly, the wire insulation was thick enough to maintain the integrity of the wiring and quickly straighten out. I like to keep my headphone cords straight because wire memory can cause them to break faster if they aren't taken care of. I think the very thin and light wire insulation of these headphones combined with the packaging may have been the reason the sound delivery is off.Because I can't make a return, these will become my backup-backup headphones. I would rather use my old pair with one working bud as a back up before these. This was my experience with these headphones and the only remark I have to say is if you're like me and have to replace your 15 dollar headphones twice a year, just spend the money to buy a pair that is higher quality and will last because the 40 dollars I've spent this year on 3 sets of headphones could have been 1 pair that won't break so fast. If these headphones worked well for others, that's great. Product reviews are very subjective and depend on a lot of factors. So just know this was the experience I had and good luck with your headphone shopping.
