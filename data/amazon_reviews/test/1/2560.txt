EDIT:After using this product for 2 months, I now must downgrade my review from 2 stars to 1 star. Here's why:Overall, the sound quality is inferior. Why? Because I just gave up and ordered a new set of wireless earbuds for 20 bucks less. The cheaper buds (ikanzi) are VASTLY superior in sound to the Tozo. I mean... it's the difference between night and day, to use a cliche.... the sound of the ikanzi is sooooo much clearer than Tozo. So why pay 50 bucks for a sound that's thin and doesn't have enough bass in the first place?Also, the Tozo earbuds are going completely haywire right now. It arbitrarily turns itself off, or turns off one ear, or turns off the radio or whatever music I'm listening to. I'll turn it back on, and it immediately turns itself back off. I mean, this happens ALL THE TIME. If I'm walking around with them for half an hour, I've had to stop and restart, or reset, or turn off and on the bluetooth, or something at least 15 times. I'm not kidding. I counted. FIFTEEN TIMES. Usually by that time, I usually just turn them off, which sucks.The volume turns itself up and down regularly- since one bud controls the up volume and the other bud controls the down volume, it's a pain to practically push the dang earbuds into my tymphatic eardrum before the volume changes. There have been times when one ear starts turning itself up while simultaneously, the other ear is turning itself down. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It really sucks not only hearing the volume going up in one ear and going down in the other, but to also hear that annoying voice saying "minimum volume" over and over in one ear, while the other ear is saying "maximum volume" over and over again in the other ear, and ALL while the music is still playing. UUUUUUGH. It makes you want to go out and shoot it or something.Also, it arbitrarily forwards music I'm playing from my iTunes, or it arbitrarily rewinds it. So imagine... you're in the middle of hearing Stairway to Heaven, and just when you get to the good part, you hear "rewind"... then silence... then starts the music from the beginning. Now, I love Stairway to Heaven, but that's too long of a song to have it repeat mid-song. But yay! Sometimes, it'll do it at the beginning of a song too. Super fun! /sarcasm.It does the same thing for forwarding songs as well, by the way. No es bueno to be listening to a song list and all the sudden, you're listening to a song that forwards to the end, and hearing the annoying voice say "forward... forward... forward..." over and over again, like she's auditioning for Ferris Bueller's Day Off to do the roll call and repeatedly ask if Ferris is in class today. Uuuuugh.Oh- here's a fun one.... I'm listening to the radio, and I'm not even listening to a song from my playlist, and I'll hear the annoying voice from the earbuds say "forward" or "rewind". What the..????!!!! I'm NOT EVEN LISTENING TO A PLAY LIST. I'M LISTENING TO THE RADIO STATION. Why is it saying "forward" or "rewind"? And super duper fun (not) when you're listening to the radio station and it starts repeating "maximum volume" over and over again (or "minimum volume" over and over) as it adjusts your volume.If you still decide to waste money on this piece of junk, you have been warned. I can't even return this junk. It's become a $50 paperweight. Literally. I'm so thankful for my cheap ikenzi. The music sounds like I'm sitting in the recording studio with the artist. That is definitely the superior product, AND it's much smaller and sits in the ear better as well.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.I've had these now for a couple of weeks so I can get an idea of how these things work. Here's what I've discovered:The good:-It has awesome sound. The bass is really good.-There is an assortment of sizes for the ear buds. That was a blessing in disguise, because I have small ears, and most headphones fall out of my ears or don't fit at all.-The charger shows exactly how much charge is remaining so you don't have to guess if your headphones are fully charged or not.-It seems relatively easy to fast forward, rewind, and pauseThe bad:The NUMBER ONE problem is that these headsets are glitchy. They arbitrarily increase and decrease in volume. I discovered that when I turn off my iPhone screen, it will arbitrarily increase and decrease volume. If I keep the playlist open on the screen, it also will arbitrarily increase and decrease the volume as well. I am positive the manufacturer knows this because many people talk about this in their reviews. It's alarming they still haven't corrected this and still sell these, and at a high price.Another issue is that one headphone will stop working altogether. Mid-song, it'll just stop, and you're just listening to music in one ear while the other ear is silent. I don't know if there's a fix, but it's irritating, and it shouldn't happen to begin with. I'm not near the charger, so I'm just out here trying to get the earpiece to start working, and nothing works. As a last ditch attempt, I'll also try to completely remove it from my bluetooth device list, but then the majority of the time, it won't re-pair, or just will re-pair with one ear and not the other. It's frustrating.Another issue is that the headset will just turn the music off over and over. Doesn't matter if I try to disconnect it from the bluetooth and then reconnect it, the headset will still continue to turn the music off. It's frustrating.A minor issue is the instruction manual. It's a bit annoying that the print is so tiny I can't read it. Why can't they enlarge the print and add an extra page? Are they really that hard up to earn cash? I still can't read the instructions and determine if there are other things I can do with these headsets. It's frustrating.These things might be minor to some, but it's frustrating to me. I gave it two stars because I think for the price, and for the fact that the manufacturers know about the glitches, yet they still continue to sell it is pretty upsetting to me. I got these headsets because the vast majority of reviewers raved about them. I saw the negative reviews as well. Somehow, I still ended up with a crap pair. I'll keep them, but I'm definitely not looking to get new ones once I either lose them or they stop working entirely.I'm keeping this review as two stars unless I hear from the manufacturers that they've fixed the issues and send me a complimentary pair to try. I'm willing to change my stars if I see the issues are resolved, but until them, it really is buyer beware. There are cheaper bluetooth headsets that offer nearly the same features.
