I thought paying over $100 for a pair of earbuds would buy me more than just a few months of useful life from the product. Unfortunately, I was wrong. At this point, I barely get any sound from the left earbud. Overall, both earbuds have been producing less sound consistently for weeks. If you are going to make this kind of investment, I would suggest exploring a different option.
