Standard size batteries (AA in this case) are supposed to be built to strict maximum size tolerances. But I happen to know that among the greatest contributers to battery capacity is volume. So some manufacturers are starting to cheat by making their batteries larger than standard size specifications. That was the case with the batteries I received -- they don't fit in my device. The diameter is too big.I find it a little hard to believe that a world-wide brand like duracell would try to get away with that, which makes me think counterfeit. The ones I received matched some of the characteristics noted by other websites as counterfeit. Avoid these. And until Amazon gets serious about dealing with counterfeit products, buy your batteries in a brick-and-mortar store.
