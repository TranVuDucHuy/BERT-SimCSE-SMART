I purchased this one to replace one I got as a gift that stopped holding the phone. This one is pretty much the same design, but seems a bit better made. And it has a release button on the underside which releases the phone to remove it from the holder. The clamp/expander that fits into the cup holder is a bit more solid and easier to use than the older model I had as well. The neck is sturdy and stays were you put it once you tighten down the locking nut on the underside of the holder. The length of the neck is perfect for my 2010 F150 putting the phone right at seat level so you can operate the screen, while stopped of course, with ease and it stays pretty still while you do too.I share my truck with my son so it gets a lot of use and seems to be holding up well. I have no concerns recommending this holder for someone wanting the convenience these devices provide.Update Oct 6th, 2020I purchased this holder in July of 2020 and it worked fine up until a few days ago. Now it will no longer release or adjust to the phone. I had high hopes for this device, but it appears it's the same quality of the last one I had. And I don't drive that often so it was getting used maybe 2-3 times a week. So from five to one star. Guess I need to keep looking for one that will last. I can no longer recommend this device unless $9 every four months meets your expectations. It does not meet mine.
