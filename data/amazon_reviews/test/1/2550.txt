The sound is fine for audio books, however you're not going to get very much range listening to music. The sound quality is what you'd expect in a 10-20 dollar pair of earbuds.The fit is very uncomfortable. At times they make my ears feel like they're under water. I've replaced the pads with another set of headphones and it made these bearable to wear.The touch response sucks. I'm on a Samsung and the headphones never can get my voice commands right.There's no volume controls on the headphones. It sucks I have to grab my phone to adjust the volume.I've tried talking on the phone with these and I've been told I sound really far away.There's no auto pause/ play function. For example, the headphones don't recognize when they are in or out of your ear. If they had this feature, when taking them out of your ear the media would be automatically be placed on pause. If someone's trying to talk with me I've got to pull out my phone pause and then resume the conversation.The case stopped charging the earbuds without a charging cable attached for the right ear the left ear charges fine.Pairing these also sucks. To initiate pairing mode you have to put them in the case, close the lid, reopen the lid and wait for pairing to complete.I can't imagine why these headphones get such good reviews.
