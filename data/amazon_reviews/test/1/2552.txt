Really wanted to give these headphones 5 stars. They had the most promise and potential to. At first, they worked fine, I was all for them. Until I realized that if they were connected to my phone or my computer and I moved they would have connection issues.I mean like, my phone is in my pocket or on the floor at the gym and in the middle of a set or of running they stop playing music, skip beats, one headphone plays music then the other one does then the other one doesn't.Or I'll be hanging in the living room, laptop less than two feet away from me, turn my head and they'll disconnect. I shouldn't have to be a living statue for these to work.Honestly, they're terrible. I don't know if I just got a bad pair or if everyone's experience with these is awful but Bluetooth headphones purpose is to wirelessly connect and play music and these can't even do that. I'd be better off buying some jank TJ Maxx wireless headphones. Would have been cheaper.
