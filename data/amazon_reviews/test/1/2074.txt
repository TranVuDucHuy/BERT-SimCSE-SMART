Ever since I purchased this, my copies had shadow copying and black streaks. I called Brother, and since it had the right stickers, it appeared as an authentic brother drum, and they could not tell me why it was streaking. They suggested it was the new toner I bought, so I bought another new toner. Same problem. I almost bought a new copier, when I decided to borrow a drum from the same type of printer and try it. The borrowed drum and toner worked flawlessly. Ugh....will no longer buy any brother toner or drums from amazon. I now go to an Office supply store. Same price and free shipping.
