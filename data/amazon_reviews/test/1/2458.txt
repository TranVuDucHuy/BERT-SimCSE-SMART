As a mask it is barely adequate. It does not have eye cups so the mask is in contact with your eyelids. To get the mask to stay on for more more than sleeping on your back you must tighten it to the point of discomfort for your eyes. The audio is actually worse. It is impossible to keep the speakers positioned so that the volume is equal in both ears. The speakers are so thick that if you're a side sleeper it is like sleeping with a rock pressed against your head.
