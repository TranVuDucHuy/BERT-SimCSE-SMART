Â I use two 32" Vizios as monitors for my PC. The screws it includes for the back of the TV are too long and it only includes two washers and no spacers to compensate for this. The fact that this is being sold as 13"-55" is false advertising since it doesn't include the hardware to SAFELY hang anything 32" or smaller. This MIGHT work for 40"+... It does include the hardware for 55" (I recognise the sizes from when I hung my 55" with a different mount). I've never seen a mount not include spacers to accommodate all the sizes it advertises.... Disappointed bec I bought this over a different one while both were on sale, now I have to return this and buy the other one at full price. Waste of time, energy, and money.
