The product itself is fine if only the charging case that it comes with didn’t break, at about at the Half to full month since I received the product it not longer reliably charges both earbuds at the same time and just continues to stay connected to the device and not charge. I don’t know if the seller sent a defective product or the product itself is defective I strongly recommend getting something else unless you want to take the gamble of getting working earbuds and charging case.
