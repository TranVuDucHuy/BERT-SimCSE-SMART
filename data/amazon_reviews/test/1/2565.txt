This was their email:______________________________________________________________________________________________"Dear Customer,Thank you for purchasing from our store(TOZO).

They didn't respond to either. I would recommend to stay away from this company. Do you know how many negative reviews have been deleted before they asked me to? I sure don't......________________________________________________________________________________________My response:"Hello,I do appreciate the response. Although, I have already purchased a replacement pair from another company. The gift card would work for my situation. At the same time, I will not remove the review. But I will modify it for others to be aware of your response and that you, as the seller are willing to assist customers as you have described in your email to make sure your customers are satisfied. I am a firm believer that reviews are to be accurate to the experience that a customer has. Even if the product I received was defective, it is still accurate.Please let me know if this will be acceptable. Have a great day!_____________________________________________________________________________________________I have had these for 6 months. Sound quality is pretty good, volume gets nice and loud but it didn't last for long. Now I constantly have them disconnecting on their own / Volume turns up on its own. I tried to find warranty information but their website link for warranty is unavailable. First and last time I purchase these.
