Yes, only 1 star.Buyers beware: After 30 days, there are no returns.We bought 3 units in good faith.The first unit began to turn itself off randomly after only 4 months. When this happens, you have to go through bluetooth pairing process. Since this happens over and over, this is impossibly time-consuming and quite frustrating.The second unit stopped receiving a charge 10 days after the first unit failed. It no longer receives a charge.After 2 units failed, we thought we better look for a different product and attempted to initiate a return on all 3. The idea was to protect ourselves against missing the 6 month or 1 year warranty period.No such luck.Amazon ignored our attempts to contact altogether. In fact, there is no way to reach Amazon to discuss the inequity of a 30 day return policy nor any other issue that isn't on their service menu. It seems to be an increasingly popular, clever way of denying service and placing all risk upon consumers.Let's be specific: HAD WE KNOWN WE ONLY HAD 30 DAYS TO RETURN AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT.This isn't a roll of toilet paper (you know what you've got when you receive it).Electronic devices require at least 6 months or 1 year warranty - or why bother at all?In fact, if JBL/Harman only warranties for 30 days... it's reasonable to think they know it's a garbage product and not going to last.The lack of accountability or service isn't the only issue with the JBL Charge 3... it is also very frustrating to use. The 'smart' button controls everything, but works with such latency (press a button... wait... it may take up to 30 seconds to respond - or not) and inconsistency (press same button... get different results) that it is mostly an exercise in frustration.There are no operational indicators; it emits a sound... that happens whether it's working or not. So you effectively operate blind. You'll need an instruction manual every time you attempt to troubleshoot this unit or expect a daisy-chain of dysfunction randomly pressing the one button looking for luck/success.Back to the 30 day no return... I would never choose to gamble on a 30 day return policy - on practically any product - let alone on electronic devices that are now manufactured as cheaply as possible. Consumer protection is a thing of the past, when '30 days no return' is acceptable.We decided to return over $1,000 more electronics we purchased recently through Amazon, before it's too late.P.S. If you're set on purchasing a JBL Charge 3, buy one or all of ours! We're selling the new ones we receive before we open them.
