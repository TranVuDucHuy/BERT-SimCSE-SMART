I wanted these to be great quality earbuds, I really did, but I am nothing but disappointed so far.The battery life is good if you look at it in terms of the series of full charge of the charging case, which should be better since its twice the size of many cases. Each individual round of life in the buds is just average. On top of that, the volume on these buds is significantly lower than the last 3 pairs I have tried. If you are going to limit the volume, I would expect better battery life in each charge.For the controls, there is no way to go back a track when listening to music, you can't even start a track over. This isn't even an annoyance, it's just missing functionality that every other bud has. And please get rid of triple-taps in functionality. Why would you leave out single-taps completely and decide to use double-taps and triple-taps.The biggest annoyance is that if I disconnect the buds even for a few minutes there is no way to awaken them without putting them back in the case. What is the point of have "long battery life" if I have to carry the case with me just to keep them functional.I definitely feel ripped off by the lack of obvious functionality in these buds. Would not recommend.
