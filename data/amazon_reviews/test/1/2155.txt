Touch controls are slow to react. The delay is 1 second. I had to turn on sound for touch control to make sure the touch worked. In 30% of cases it fails. At the same time when you try to fix earphones position in your ear, controls can do something unintended, stop, skip, increase volume dramatically . 2 second touch doesn't work for me to control ANC. I have to use their app that uses phone battery, takes space, access my phone data.They are not very comfortable. My ears hurt and skin feels irritated after three hours of wearing them. It's the hard plastic part that hurts.There is no place for the charging cable in the case. Cable is huge and thick. Cable should be small and should fit into the case so everything could be carried around in one place.Those earphones need design improvement in the sense of comfort and functionality.I tried to use it during the flight, the noise cancelling does not work, soundcore was no use during the flight.I tried to use it to call my phone. The sound is impossibly loud when I dial and there is no way to turn it down, touch function doesn't work while dialing. Microphone sound/ clarity is very poor, I tested it with my own voicemail.It's only good to listen to music at home. I would not recommend it for use while flying or to make important calls.
