I had repeated charging issues with the earbuds. I'll charge the case during the day, put the earbuds in the case at night, then put the buds in my ears in the morning, and half of the time they're dead. I've also tried charging the case at night with the buds in it, but the buds are dead in the morning.I'll be returning this item even though they are comfortable and have decent call quality when they work.
