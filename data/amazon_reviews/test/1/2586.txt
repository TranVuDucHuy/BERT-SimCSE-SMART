I am livid. I have had these a few months. They are meh but were fine for a kid. The other day I was unplugging them and the metal insert completely came off in my iPad. Now my $$ device is completely useless because we can’t play sound with the headphones but worse we CAN NOT PLAY SOUND AT ALL bc the headphones broken piece makes the iPad think it’s still hook up to headphones. $1k down the drain.
