This microphone is an absolute abomination. First of all, unless you yell into it, it doesnâ€™t amplify your voice at all. Connecting to Bluetooth is useless - the music coming out sounds worse than trying to use a kids walkie talkie from 1992. Even the carabiner from the outside of the case broke without even touching it. This is getting sent back tomorrow and thanks for ruining Christmas.
