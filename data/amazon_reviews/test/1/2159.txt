Even at this price point, you expect the earbuds not to cut out. But regardless of whether I’m using Windows or iOS, they cut out for 3-5 seconds with increasing frequency.Done all the standard troubleshooting and firmware updates, but this seems to be an issue that’s been going on for some time.I would not recommend.---------After leaving this review, Anker sent me an automated message asking what the issue was with the product, which I already stated above. So, I let them know again, then told me I'd need to reach out to Amazon because I bought it from Amazon. So i guess they were sOoOoOo concerned about their unreliable product that they didn't take the time to read the negative feedback, but had plenty of time to reach back out to me and say "NOT OUR PROBLEM"lol.
