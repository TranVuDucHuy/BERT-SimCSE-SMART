With 6% negative reviews I decided to register my Charge 3. Using Google I found the JBL registration page and hundreds of items were listed, but not a single JBL Bluetooth product. No email addresses listed for product support - just a single 1-800 number ... that would be a fool's' errand so I did not even try it.Yes, JBL claims a warranty in their bundled literature, but no web site mentioned, no nothing. Using Google I was able to find JBL's product registration page but not a single Bluetooth item is referenced. Nothing. I was unable to register my Charge 3. JBL takes my money with an ear-to-ear grin and turns its back on me. And you.In 1925 Benito Mussolini was asked during a radio interview to define Fascism & he replied that it as a conjoining of the largest corporations with the federal government thus creating a Mega-Force not answerable to anyone, not even to themselves. We have arrived at that moment. Big government is in bed the largest corporations and vice versa, hence the coinage of a new term, "corporatism". I feel as if I am dealing with a faceless, anonymous and irreproachable behemoth.The Charge 3 works perfectly but if something were to go awry then I am SOL. Not a good way to run a company.Caveat emptor!
