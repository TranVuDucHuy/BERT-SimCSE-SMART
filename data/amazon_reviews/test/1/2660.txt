This charger doesn't charge well, or at all really. I've tried a few different cases and also tried using the included ring on a non magnetic case and it will act like it is going to charge, then immediately stops. It attaches to the vent in my vehicle okay and the magnetic hold is decent, but I bought this for the wireless charging capabilities and it just doesn't work. I also tried a couple of different cables, assuming there may be something faulty with the included cable, but no. Same issue regardless of cable used.
