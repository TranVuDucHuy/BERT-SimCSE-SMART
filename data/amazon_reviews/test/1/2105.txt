The 2 cords started out charging and I was thrilled to have a 10 foot cords 1 month later my IPhone 14 Pro Max showed a message that the accessory did not support the IPhone. The second cord stated there was water in the cord and could not work. These charging cables are not certified with Apple if that message is displayed. Cheap is cheap and you get what you paid for .. a big nothing. Returning it and buying a better charging cable.
