I needed to get some wireless earbuds, primarily to take meetings while working remotely and on the move. I was hesitant to spend bigger money as I have not owned a pair of wireless ear buds and wanted to give these a try first.First impression was OK: packaging, look, feel etc. of the earbuds was decent. The different silicone ear pieces were convenient and easy to change. Initial operation was easy (pairing and setting up). But...It didn't take long for me to realize why these were so much more inexpensive than the big brands. Sound quality was "tinny" and sounded hollow. BT functionality was spotty at best (tried with multiple devices), even dropping out completely (on a full charge), needing to be disconnected, then repaired for sound to return. At one point the earbuds began crackling like an old AM radio causing some discomfort and for me to respond by pulling them out of my ears abruptly. Also, as I talked or even moved around, the earbuds would slide out and I had to constantly adjust them to keep. I tried multiple sizes of the included silicone ear pieces and none of them made the fit any better.I returned these and ended up breaking down and getting a more expensive pair (well worth the money).Bottom line, if it is important to have good quality sound, reliable connectivity and function, as well as fit, just go for the higher quality earbuds.
