Saw a lot of good reviews. Purchased the mic. It worked at first then suddenly dropped to like 5-10% volume even though the level was at 85% or maxed out. Resetting the device in the control panel would often temporarily fix the problem. I figured what the hell I don't mind resetting the device every day or so as long as the sound was pretty decent for the price.But alas it came to a point where it failed again, a reset did not do the trick. I returned it to get a replacement. The replacement arrived a day later. I opened it up and the product appeared to have been repackaged (i.e. I sincerely wonder if the person returning the item prior to repackaging and sending to me was not complaining of the same exact problem).If you get a good product off the bat then I think it will be a good value. If you do have to return it please ask for a refund and go with another product as at that point you will just be an unwilling participant in the distributors game of defective electronics hot potato. Who knows maybe you will get one of the two I returned.Best of luck!
