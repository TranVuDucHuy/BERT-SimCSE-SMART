First, it’s cute in a small compact sense. But the bass is HORRIBLE!! Too much rattling & sounds like a stock system in a basic Corolla. I would send it back if I had kept the dang box. My basic cheap blue tooth speaker sounded better. For the price there is way better. I decided to go with my first choice, Harmon Kardon Onyx 7. Unfortunately, not through Amazon since I didn’t want to wait a month+ for it to be delivered. If you listen to songs sans bass, it sounds sufficient. Very disappointed JBL.
