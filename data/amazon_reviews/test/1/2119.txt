I was hoping to prevent my microwave from tripping the main breaker when other appliances are also running. Sadly, it trips this device by itself. Don't recommend using with small appliances like microwaves, coffee makers, etc. There is literally a photo in the listing that shows small appliances plugged into it! ðŸ˜‚
