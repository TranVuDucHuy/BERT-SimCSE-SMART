While I'm not an audiophile, I DO know good sound when I hear it so trust me.. these things are really anemic in the "bottom end". The 9mm drivers, 20hz-20Khz range and 97dB/mW specs for these ErgoFits are pretty standard for good sounding buds so I assume the problem must be with Panasonic designing the speaker outlets on these as OVALS instead of round in the interest of more ergos and comfort.. Well, they should've left it alone because they're not any more comfortable and tbh, are closer to screetchy nails on a chalkboard than anything with "hi-fidelity" :-/By the way, it has NOTHING to do with which size adapter is installed for "making a better seal", etc. See, since these Panasonic ErgoFits and some other buds called JVC Riptidz were both under six bucks, I got both and just tried them side-by-side. It was like night and day!To those that feel the bass on these is adequate, it may be because you don't have another set for an immediate relative comparison, or it's just a matter of taste where bass isn't a priority.I'm not surprised the Riptidz blew these out of the water because they've got bigger drivers, a wider freq range and higher output overall.JVC Riptidz: 11mm drivers, 10hz-20Khz range, 101dB/mW output.Panasonic ErgoFit: 9mm drivers, 20hz-20Khz range, 97dB/mW output.It's just a matter of physics and the numbers don't lie: the Riptidz deliver more quantity of low end, while the mids and highs were more similar. But even for songs (or parts of songs) where the low end wasn't prevalent, the ErgoFits seemed shrill, cold and lifeless in comparison while the Riptidz were better balanced tonally.I probably wouldn't have been so harsh on these Ergofits if I didn't have the Riptidz for a relative side-by-side comparison, so you may actually find these, "OK".To sum up, I'd advise steering clear of these and going with the JVC's or you may find yourself fiddling with ear adapters and your EQ in some futile hunt for all the missing BASS. And you won't find it because Panasonic killed it in their R&D lab with these stupid "oval holes" lol.
