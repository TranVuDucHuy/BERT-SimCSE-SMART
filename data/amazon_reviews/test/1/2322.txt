This produced had some promise. It was small, light-weight, comfortable for the most part (depends how long you wear for.) and initially seemed wonderful.That is until I started to realize that the other person would sound muffled when they spoke and during a conversation I would barely understand the other person. Not a volume issue, that only makes it worse.Not only am I having difficulty hearing people, but they tell me that my call sounds robotic and cuts in and out, even over wifi calling and on full 5G signal.The noise canceling seems to work very well but overall this product isn't worth it.
