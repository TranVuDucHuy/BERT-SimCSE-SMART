It is extremely thin and flimsy. I thought itll harden up once i laminated it but all it did was create a bubble around the flash cards and didnt laminate it properly at all. I thought i just overcrowded it and so i tried to space out my cards from each other but it was still the same. Do not buy it, you'll just waste your money.
