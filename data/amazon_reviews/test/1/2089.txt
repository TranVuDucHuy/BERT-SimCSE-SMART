I bought these at the very end of November and here it is the very beginning of February and not one of these chargers has worked. I was going to return them and then I realized I threw half of them in the trash because they wereâ€¦trash. I wish I had been more careful because I really deserve to get my money back. I have never hated a product more than this one. It is awful, none of them work, I don't think any of them worked longer than a month, if that. It is such a waste of money that even the small amount of $10 feels monumental because they just didn't even work for a minute hardly. I think they need to take this terrible product off of this site.
