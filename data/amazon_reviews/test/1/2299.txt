The labels are good enough in the end, but you have to mess with the settings every time you plug the thing in to avoid blowing through 3 times the amount of tape that you need. Brother is shady, if you buy this at least buy cheap off brand label tape so Brother doesn't benefit as much from their scam. I recommend a different label maker
