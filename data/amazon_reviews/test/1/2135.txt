Once the initial charge wears off, it won’t recharge and it only shows 20% charge stay away from this. only had 4 months and now it won’t hold a charge for more than 30 min. Other reviewers are having the same issue. 69 bucks down the drain. I would not purchase again. manufacturer please reach out to me for refund/return and I will happily change my review!
