Got this on a black friday/cyber monday deal. Figured it would be a great purchase for casual photos and videos. Spec-wise it would be a great card, if it worked... My computer could not recognize the sd card. After ejecting it and putting it back in a couple times, the sd card finally seemed operable. I brushed it off as a glitch at first. I formatted it in my camera and tested it by taking pictures and a couple videos, unfortunately once I put it back in the computer it could not be read. I once again ejected it and put it back in several times and it eventually worked. However when I tried accessing my content, the content would fail while loading or the card would crash entirely and be unreadable again. Additionally, I tested it against my old sandisk extreme 16gb 40mb/s sd card. The old sd card had absolutely no problems. Also, my computer is pretty high end so I'm sure it is not a computer problem. It may be helpful to note that a couple other reviews within the past year have also mentioned this defect. I will be returning this card. Unfortunately since it was a black friday deal, the price has gone back up so I'm not sure if I will be able to purchase another sandisk to replace this defective one.
