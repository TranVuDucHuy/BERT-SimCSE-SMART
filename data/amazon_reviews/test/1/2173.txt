Get one that clamps instead, this magnet is not powerful enough for a simple right turn.I installed per the instructions, and took off to work, turning out of my driveway the phone fell off and landed in the passenger footwell. My phone is a Pixel 6 Pro, in a silicone case (thankfully after the fall there was no damage). Cannot trust it with my phone, it is way too important to my work.
