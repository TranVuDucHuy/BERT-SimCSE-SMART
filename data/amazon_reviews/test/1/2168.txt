I have an Samsung Galaxy S8 and it says that it works with Android phones. The stand seemed exactly what I wanted, something that could get my phone off my desk while working. If you try to hit any button on the phone while on the stand, it starts to lean backward. It doesn't slide as it has the anti-slip grips on the bottom. There is something wrong with the design with it's center of gravity to prevent it from tipping. The only way it won't tip, is if the phone is in a parallel position to the surface the stand is on - which is pointless. If you are using this just to watch video or view your phone, then it may work for you.
