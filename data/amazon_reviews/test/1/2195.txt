I was hoping to get a slightly better mic than I'd been using for recording some voice over stuff. The room is practically silent(for a home studio set up) so I wasn't worried over a super amazing mic. But a mic that actually picks up sound would be nice. If I shout into it it can detect up to 12% on the windows mic test with the volume maxed out. I've watched YouTube reviews to see, and others have the same issue. They have to boost the audio 10x after recording to make get it to normal audible levels. And by then you have to filter out a ton of background noise that's also increased. Ugggg. After days of messing with this trying to find a way to make it work, I'm just going to buy a yeti or something. Maybe it's a dud but I've wasted enough time and would like to get back to recording audio books.
