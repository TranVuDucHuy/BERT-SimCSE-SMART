Came without a cable. Nuff said dawg.Update: went out to Guitar Center, which is the only damn store around that carries XLR Male to Female cables for miles around. Okay I get back to my place to hook it all up aaaaand it's not compatible with my preexisting mic arm from my previous USB Microphone. This brand really screws you at every opportunity. Will not be giving them anymore stars than 1 I have given them, wish I can give them a zero.Update after several days of use, I will be returning this product, no noticeable improvement in audio quality over my old Samson C01U Pro USB microphone. Very upsetting but glad I'll be getting a full refund.
