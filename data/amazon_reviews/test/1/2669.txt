This charger does NOT charge at 15W on an iPhone. I tested and saw 7.2W with an 18W QC 3.0 power source. I expected this result as unless it's Apple MagSafe certified, it will not charge at 15W, and clearly, this is not. Otherwise, it works decently as a 7.5W wireless charge with a MagSafe-style mount.If it was advertised for what it really was, I'd give it 4 stars with the 1-star ding solely because it was not 15W.
