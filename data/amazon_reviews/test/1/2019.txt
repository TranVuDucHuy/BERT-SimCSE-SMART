Item has caused tv to fall and nearly injured me in the process. The first time the tv fell while I was reaching behind to plug in my HDMI. I attributed that one to my thick hand not being as gentle from behind. The second time neatly landed on my dog. Of course Iâ€™m past my return window so hopefully this review can save someone else time as well as keep those you love safe.
