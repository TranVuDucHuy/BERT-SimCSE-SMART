This device destroyed the USB port I plugged it into, ruining the entire board that the port was attached to. The port that it damaged and the ones next to it will never work again, which is too bad.Against my better judgement I decided to plug the device into a different computer, and while it didn't destroy the USB ports on that machine, it didn't do anything either.I guess I'll give it credit though, the device could have been worse, it could have destroyed the hard drive I plugged it into instead. But that still works. Still, it's an awful device, I would never have bought it if I knew before hand.
