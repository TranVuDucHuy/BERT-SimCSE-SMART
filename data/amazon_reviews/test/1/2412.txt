This cable is stiff as a board.Note that the cable works. however, I give it only 1 star because the cable is inferior and cheap and to make sure my review goes in the negative column, not the positive, where I believe it has more impact because personally, the way I use reviews to determine if a product is worth buying is that I ignore the positives and read the negative reviews, which I find more helpful an informative.So the reason for my bad review of this cable is that it's stiff as a board and can be bent which is a telltale sign of inferior grade wire inside. It also means that it more easily becomes unplug from device sockets and also stresses them whenever this stiff cable is jostled or moved than does a cable made of nice, supply high quality wire.For instance, low grade copper wire is stiff but high grade pure copper wire is very supple and very flexible but not bendable.and cords and cables made out of high grade copper are supple and do not bend good cables, which this is not, also drape.These cables will not drape because they are junk.this cable is VERY stiff and therefore made of inferior, low quality conductor materials. it's so stiff that I have to be concerned that it will tip over and drag my heavy, bulky Nikon DSLR camera off the edge of my bed when the cable is connecting it to my PC! on the other hand I don't have to worry about tripping on it between the bed and the PC because it literally suspends itself in the air between them! I'm returning it for a better brand that's flexible and supple.I can't beleive Amazon ahs the nerve to put it's name on, and "recommend" such utter garbage as this.
