I have purchased scores of these cartridges over the years. This is the second time within the last two years that a cartridge (out of the box) has been fundamentally flawed. This cartridge produces large blobs of black ink which then impacts (clogs) the color printing heads so nothing is produced (except for large runny blobs of black ink). The production quality on the production lines must be slipping or they shifted their production to low-cost, low-performing centers (from one over-seas location to another). One would guess sourced from China, but is hard to know.
