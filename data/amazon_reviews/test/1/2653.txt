I've owned Bluetooth speakers before but I wanted something that was small enough to fit in my pocket so I could take with me. So the first day this speaker worked perfectly fine the sound was okay for such a tiny speaker and it paired with my devices just fine. I used the USB cable that came with it and I got a solid blue light indicating that it was charging just the way it was supposed to. After the battery was at a hundred percent I unplugged it and put it away for the following day. At the end of the week the battery had reached twenty percent, so I plugged it in and got a flashing blue light indicating it was trying to pair with a device instead of charging. I reset the speaker multiple times, turned it off and on multiple times, used different USB cables, tried different wall outlets, used different wall chargers and even connected it to my PC. Nothing worked and now as I make this review the battery has finally reached zero percent and being that I can't charge it it's now just a paperweight. As irritated as I am I about this I spent less than twenty bucks on this thing so it's not like I'm out of a lot of money, but still I was hoping to get more than just a week of use out of this thing.
