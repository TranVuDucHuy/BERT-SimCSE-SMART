I bought this speaker in May 2020 and have only used it a handful of times. Recently, I brought it on vacation and have been enjoying it while bike riding. Truly this speaker has amazing sound quality for the size... Today we were enjoying some tunes while biking- I always hook the speaker/case to my bag that I hook to my handle bars, and at one point the music "stopped" and I mused aloud to my husband, "I had wondered when the battery would finally run out", b/c I had been using it for a few hours over the course of the week w/out having to charge it. Unfortunately, I didn't expect the case to break and didn't hear the speaker fall, so truly just assumed the battery died. It wasn't until over an hour later that we returned home and I noticed I only had the metal o-ring clip attached to the little ribbon tab (that used to be attached to the seam of the case). I drove back and forth where I remembered commenting on the life of the speaker battery, but it was not there... Very disappointing. One positive- the speaker isn't big bucks.. My recommendation: get the speaker, but invest in a different case, or secure it in a different way if biking or hiking, etc.
