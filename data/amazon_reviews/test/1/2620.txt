I bought this memory card because I’d known SanDisk to be durable and reliable, however I was sorely disappointed with the performance on this one. After a few months it suddenly “stopped reading”, my files became corrupted, and even after ‘formatting’ I was never able to really use the card again, because every time I would store photos or videos, after a while, I’d have formatting issues.
