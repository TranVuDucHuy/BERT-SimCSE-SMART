Online reviews for Brother HL3270 say this is a terrible printer because the toner cartridges are defective. I have used Brother for 30 years and loved my last Brother. Bought this for a 2nd office area I am setting up rather than moving main office printer around, and for printing color. Initially worked great, but started failing within 70 pages because of dirty print jobs. Print jobs got worse and wose. Bought this $58 cartridge to replace original unit that came with machine. Started printing dirty copies from day 1. I can't believe Brother is selling such defective units -- the artridge in a new machine, and this, a replacement cartridge. They must know of this problem, but want us to simply buy new cartridges rather than pulling defective units off market because our time means nothing to them. Its more profitable for us to just buy them and hope some of us will live with defective units rather than pulling units from market and manufacturing new batch..
