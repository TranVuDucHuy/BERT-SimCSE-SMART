Bought this for my wife's car. Installed the adhesive pad on the dash (which is how most should install, as mounting on the windshield will always obstruct some of your view). Cleaned the dash, applied the pad and waited 24 hours before adding the phone mount. Seemed to be very strong and sturdy. The next day, my wife reported that it fell off while driving. She gave it to me with the suction cup still attached to the adhesive pad. So suction works fine, but the adhesive seems to be weak. I will probably have to DIY this now with some double sided tape that actually sticks.
