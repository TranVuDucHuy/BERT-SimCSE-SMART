I bought these because of a number of good reviews, but these headphones are some of the worst I’ve tried recently. The price point is pretty good, so that might be why they are appealing to a lot of people, but they don’t fit well in your ears, the battery life is quite short, and the Bluetooth connection is seemingly quite weak.They give you a few options to try out different sizes, but because the touch control part of the headphone is so big and heavy, it doesn’t matter how hard you stuff them into your ears. And, yes, the instructions say to insert facing down and rotate them into position, and this does set them momentarily. Problem is that any movement: walking, cleaning, jumping, even just eating lunch, will dislodge the headphone. It’s annoying to have to mess with them every few minutes since the touch controls are so sensitive it’ll cause you to skip forwards, backwards, sometimes even turn them off unwillingly.The battery life is also nothing impressive. I bought these with the intention of using them in the gym or while doing chores, so no super lengthy events, but even fully charged they do not last the 8 hours of active use that it says on the box. You might get half that, if you’re lucky.I’ve also had a few connectivity issues which seem to pop up when first taking them out of the charger or after pausing playback for longer than 20-30 seconds. It seems like one headphone’s connection gets dropped usually just momentarily. Nothing crazy, but a little annoying, and I’ve had to reset them a few times because if it.Noise cancellation isn’t something I’ve noticed with these. Yes, if you jam them into your ears so hard you hear your blood pumping, you will block out exterior noise, but the same could be done with any headphone of a similar style, and isn’t recommended either way.
