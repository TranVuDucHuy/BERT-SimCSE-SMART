Took it out the box, turned it on - only the power LED comes on - no battery indicator, no startup sound, cannot pair it, nothing else happens. Have tried resetting, have tried charging it first, nothing. Seems the internal electronics are fired straight from the box. I work on a ship so nearly impossible to return as well - didn't think it would be necessary to return for a renowned brand like JBL. Very disappointed.
