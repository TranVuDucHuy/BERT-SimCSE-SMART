The New bee Bluetooth headset is well made but has consistent connectivity problems.Compared to my recently deceased Explorer 500, the New bee is about twice the volume (i.e. size), about the the same weight. It wears well with the ear hook (otherwise it won't stay in my ear), pairs easily with my phone. The voice and music rendering in the earpiece is a bit more tinny than in my previous headset, but it does the job.So far I have not received any complaints on the call quality - but the New bee has major and consistent connectivity issues. It consistently gives an annoying "disconnected" audio warning during calls and when streaming audio, even though the connection is usually instantly recovered. This connection problem is clearly caused by the New Bee, happening on two different Android flagship phones. Based on this disruptive behavior I won't use it for calls.Battery life is ok, typically about 6 to 8 hours when driving and listening to podcasts or music.The headset charges quickly, typically in an hour or two.The price of this Bluetooth headset is right, but unfortunately its performance is unacceptable. I would not buy this item again.
