I had moderately high hopes for this speaker. Its' "redline" price is supposedly $120, amazon sold it to me for $55.It's a decent size, nice and portable. However, when paired via bluetooth there is tons of crackling and static when playing any song. The phone and speaker are both stationary and close to each other. The base is completely nonexistent, which is pretty shocking for a speaker of this size.I immediately plan to return these, so I can't accurately judge batter life.If you like music, get something else. These are worth $20 at best.
