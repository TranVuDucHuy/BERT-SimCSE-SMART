Each label leaves a massive amount of blank tape at the beginning and end. Margin adjustment only decreases tape waist at the end of the label and has no affect on the beginning, so you need to carry a scissors to trim the beginning of the label to match the one sided margin adjustment. I’m surprised a product specifically for making labels would even be released with such limitations and quirks. The screen isn’t lit and can’t be in any dim lighting or you can’t see anything. Just a horrible product with no highlights to speak of. My first brother product and the last. I wouldnt consider the printer line or anything else after this experience. Absolute junk and a waist of my time and money. I would return, but need something immediately for a work project. I will still try after it’s done if I don’t smash it on the floor before hand.
