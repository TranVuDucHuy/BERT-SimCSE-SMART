Overall - great pair of earbuds for the price. I got them specifically for the ENC/call clarity because I travel a bunch and need to take calls. Don't worry, I am not the guy on the plane or in the gym, but when I take walks or at a coffee shop ... I am that guy.Pros and Cons below:Pros:- Sound is great. Could hear it over the shower and better than my older earbuds.- I was on a call and tried another pair and this one, and this one by far was superior. The call clarity and the lack of background noise it picked up. And they are ENC not ANC, so it doesn't cut out the noise completely for me, but it did dampen it and the volume is loud enough I had no problem hearing the other person. The better I hear, the less I instinctually raise my voice - which is helpful for everyone.- They are indeed Waterproof ... took a shower and no issues. Including it pausing from the water hits or changing my podcast. It says don't go swimming, so I won't ... but was impressed by the shower.- Easy to work and paired right away- The different colored ends help for R & L distinction. Small detail but significant.- They are light, barely notice they are there.Neither her nor there:- I can't tell which size fit is right for the silicon but they seem to stay in ok.- Same issue I have with all earbuds with silicon.Negatives:Wish the case had more clear delineation of the the battery level.Overall:You will not be upset with your purchase ... these are fantastic.
