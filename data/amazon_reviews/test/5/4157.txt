So here I am ready to write up this fine review. I actually ordered these around black Friday in 2021, ordered 2 pairs for myself assuming I, or my son would lose an ear-bud. I bought a 3rd pair for my father-in-law. I spent a total of $98 for 3 pairs($28-$34USD each), beat that Raycon! I'm a big fan of guys-talking or Podcasts as people call them so I've used the same headphones DAILY while I work IT and Incident Management 8-11hours per day, 5 days a week. I've also popped these bad boys in when falling asleep for a nice motivational podcast a few nights a week.I'm an Arizona resident and recently my pool went swamp green after a dust storm in October(rare), being that chlorine is expensive enough to finance, I opted to drain my pool. So here I am, listening to Joe Rogan, ripping some legal Blue Dream and cleaning my empty pool with liquid chlorine and muriatic acid. While having the jolliest of times sucking filtered air through a respirator and wearing heavy duty rubber gloves - I felt an ear bud slipping out my ear from all the movement(rare). Being there was flesh burning acid on my gloves, I hoped for the best but needless to say the headphone fell out my ear and tumbled into a pool of acid and chlorine. At the time it was night, my headlamp wouldn't shine through the fog of acidy water pooled up. I felt defeated, a whole year of not losing these important headphones and the time I contemplated using them, I lose one. I tried to scoop out the ear bud but couldn't see it in the water, so in the baking soda/soda ash and acid neutralizing chemicals go to start draining out this concoction. After about 20 minutes, I spot the ear bud and assume its fried and probably shouldn't place it in my ear hole after it soaked in ACID for 20ish minutes. I was determined though, never will I pay more than $35 for simple headphones that bang.After finishing the pool acid wash, I cleaned up. Took the headphone to a glass bowl, dumped a heap of baking soda and some water to make a paste and submerged the headphone while stirring it around. Then I poured vinegar all over the headphone to hopefully neutralize the acid this headphone absorbed for 20ish minutes. My hopes were cloud 9.I set this earbud on my work desk with a fan pointed toward it and forgot about it for about 24-26 hours. The next day, I placed a new rubber fitting(these come with many different sizes) and popped it in my ear. To my hopes, she worked like she had never soaked in acid. I can only hope I do not lose my ear, ear drum, get cancer or die but I'll be damned if I spend more money on headphone to listen to guys talking (podcasts).Updated: The date is 12/12/21, about 6 weeks later. I also run a detail business. So here I am tackling a 2016 F150 king cab long bed, jamming guys talking with my Tozo NC2s in my ear holes. Quite the long interior cleanup with a basic exterior hand wash including removal off splattered egg that's been beaten by the sun(damn teens, always uncalled for). The in-laws had the traditional Christmas pizza cookout party at 530pm and time was running tight. The time came to pack up but I had an unexpected visit about a Dodge RAM TRX in which I popped out my Tozo ear buds and left them on the side of bed rail of the F150.. I was in a rush to pack up and go, given I had lost time trying to score another detail job,... I forgot to get my oh so important ear buds! Luckily I had my backups and still had to go back to the truck about 56 hours later but what happens in that time? Phoenix gets unexpected rain. A good amount of rain. And the owner was bound to drive his newly cleaned out truck. Nerves were definitely high but didn't bother to tell the owner as I figured my earlier mistake dooped me out of my ol' trusty ear buds...The day had come, a quick touch up of the F150. The first thing I looked for? Ear buds. Where could they be?! Immediately I found one! Hopes were anxiously high but the job had to be done as I had obligations to get back to my son. After finishing the job, I gave a most stellar search through the wet rock and puddled water to find the second ear bud!! This fine piece of hardware was smoothered into mud that I had stepped in previously while cleaning the truck. Oh boy. Yet excitement was high and curious if it was to soaked to work again. I mean it sat in drenched mud for over 16 hours... Being a detailer I had rubbing alcohol handy and gave both ear buds a thorough cleanup. I couldn't wait and immediately popped them in my charging case to see their simple white charging light brighten my hopes and instantly tried to take over my Bluetooth connection of the 2nd pair of earbuds which I currently had in my ear holes!Now I'm listening to guys talking as I type this now with these truely tested ear buds! Worth your money folks. Enjoy!And I guess that is just showbiz baby--------------I wasn't put on this earth to review this product but I'd be damnrd if I didn't. Today is Wednesday, 1/18/2023. Post pandemic. The US dollar is becoming the next penny. I'm working my IT job for 9.5 hours long for thousands of penny's and and using my Tozo noise canceling ear buds to listen to guys talking and the time comes to get off work. My wife and 2 year old boy went on a walk to the park only a few blocks away so I figure, "why not hop on the bicycle and go find them? Heck I could still listen to guys talking while getting my heart pumping." So that is exactly what I did, ....but the wrong direction. I rode 1 mild the wrong way and back tracked 1.7 miles the right way. Luckily I spot my wife and 2 year old son who told me "dad! Rip the meanest wheelies you've done in 10 years!" ....I obliged. I ripped numerous wheelies. One wheelies sent me on my behind(ass). This must of been when my Tozo earbuds went missing.....Fast forward 3 hours; I'm looking for the Tozies, anxious for some guys talking and to do some house chores... They're no where to be seen. They're not connecting... "dang nabbit!!" I screamed in my head. 'They must be in the street when I was going extreme' ..I grab my boy and have him hold the wheel while I shine my craftsman flashlight out the window. "HOLY SHNIKES! TOZO!" I gasped! There they were in all there well built glory, nestled on the side of the road. Not sure but they may of even been ran over but guess what? Yeah, they still work just fine! Thank you Tozo!
