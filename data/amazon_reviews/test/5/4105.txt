This product allows me to connect a lot of things to it and still put it away under the desk without taking much space or be visible. I love that it has the plugs oriented in different ways to allow those big bricks that take a lot of space. This makes things a lot more organized under my desk and I recommend it.The fact that it also has a surge protector and seems to actually work (based on other reviews I saw before I bought it), I decided to go for it and I couldn't be happier with it. I just wish I knew about this product before.I definitely recommend this product to put at any desk or TV set.
