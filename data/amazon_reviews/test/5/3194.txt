As I type this, I am using the cable to display 4k 60Hz from my DVI-only AMD RX 470 in Windows 11. DVI is normally limited to 1920x1080 in Windows due to the 165 MHz pixel clock limit, and I could only display 1080p resolution by default. I had to download and run the free AMD/ATI Pixel Clock Patcher which increases the clock limit. The author of this software is well-known and trustworthy, and he also has a version that works with nVidia cards. There may also be software out there that patches this limit on built-in Intel video. Note that very old AMD/nVidia cards or the built-in video on Intel CPUs may not support 4k 60Hz, and no unlock would likely work on them. Please note that you'll need to reboot after applying the patch and you'll need to reapply the patch every time you update your video card driver (may happen every few months or never).
