I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.
