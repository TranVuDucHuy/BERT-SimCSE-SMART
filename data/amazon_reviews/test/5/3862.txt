I'm kind of new to the podcasthing thing and at first I was disappointed with the sound quality. It was only as good as the $5 desktop mic I replaced. Then I figured out that I had to speak directly into the mic rather than just having it to the side of me on my desk. If I speak directly into the mic the sound quality is amazing. I was really hoping not to have to move the mic directly in front of me each time I recorded, so I started looking for some type of arm that I could connect above me so I could just bring it in when I needed it but I can't seem to find any clamp that fits the mic since it's so wide. Even the ones that say they work with "blue yet" are too small. I've tried two already; neither fits. Other than that, I love the mic.
