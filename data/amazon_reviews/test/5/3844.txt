I wanted one device that charges two iPhones (11 & 13) and my apple watch 6. This thing works great. I leave them on the charger over night, so i haven't tested time to charge each device. But the magsafe charger works with my iPhone 13 magsafe case. Both sides charge my iPhone 11 (doesn't have magsafe). This thing does exactly what i was hoping.
