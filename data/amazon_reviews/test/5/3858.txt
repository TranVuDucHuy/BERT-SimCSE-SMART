5 stars because of the price. I am quite amazed at these headphones for the price. Like wine, I rate headphones based on their price point and these are, for sure, the best I have tried in this price range.Pros- noise canceling. These are not active noise canceling headphones, but they do a great job in isolating outside noise.- sound quality. I am shocked at how good these sound with music. I also listen to some talk radio and while not as good, they are still pretty great.- comfortable ear pads- quickly and easily connected to multiple devices- long battery lifeCons- I have a huge head. I buy fitted hats in size "biggest you sell". These are a bit tight on my head but I am going to try and stretch them out as I have heard others have had success. If not, my girlfriend gets these.SummaryAt this price point (I paid $25, usually run a little higher), I can't imagine a better on-ear headphone.
