Most people don't have developed hearing and can't tell the difference between a $40 piece of audio gear and a $4000 one.With that caveat in mind, I bought a $300 pair of headphones a couple years ago. I now wish I had bought several pairs of these instead. Let me explain.I got into amateur audio production back when Covid hit. Been a music lover and musician all my life, but until I recently started to do this deep dive into sound design and production I didn't understand how much I needed to develop my listening skills.During all this time, I'm also learning about equipment. What these headphones taught me in 30 seconds is that sometimes the design is way more important than the quality specs.Where that became obvious for me is the plugs and cords in this package. You get two cords with the two standard sizes for jacks. The larger plug attachment has a strain relief design about six inches from the equipment plug end, which can be wrapped around any kind of available anchor on the gear rack or whatever.This is crucial, because my $300 headphones lasted a few weeks before that plug began to fail and my investment was wasted due to wear that accumulated by virtue of my own minimal use, making them effectively useless and unreplaceable.These headphones sound just as good to my minimally trained ears, but will last much longer and I will be able to afford replacements I can keep in storage till I need them, have extra pairs for multiple listening stations, extras for group activities where I don't want people beating up expensive gear, etc. ad infintum... and I still would have saved money after going through a dozen pairs and never noticed the difference other than the fact that these headphones ARE STILL WORKING.I hope the logic here is immediately obvious in terms or return on investment.
