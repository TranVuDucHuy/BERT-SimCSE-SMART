A lot sturdier than it looks. Easy to install, must be installed into a stud. Used for a 55” TV.Since it had to be installed into a stud, it couldn’t be centered exactly on the wall. Could be if It was pulled out further from wall, but the TV looks better closer to the wall.Overall, very happy with it.
