In the past, of bought A LOT of dud storage cards, but any SanDisk card I’ve purchased has never given me a problem. This one is no exception. I am a freelance photographer and videographer in my free time and I’m able to place multiple cards in my camera for added storage during a shoot. With other lower MB/s rate cards my camera has had issues with not writing to the card fast enough, which can make for a very frustrating shoot. The process speed on this card is great, I normally take photos in raw, and I never have to wait to review the photos or videos on site. I’ve been using this card for about two months now, and it has yet to give me any issues when transferring my photos or videos after a job to my computer or a storage drive! Hope this helps someone!
