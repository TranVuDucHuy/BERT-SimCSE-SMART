I use a SD card for extra storage in my laptop, as backup, and to carry handy files which eventually I may need to use in other computer. I save USB connectors and doesn't protrude from laptop body.The card is fast, I copy several files, install from it, I use Win 11 and Linux, and it works very well.The price was phenomenal for the card
