I thought I would never have to purchase this product because I have a hub for my MacBook. However, the hub gave an unstable connection to my mouse. Maybe because of the overload of how many devices I use simultaneously. I purchased a different brand before but this one gave the most stable connection to my mouse. I know it is annoying to take additional port plugging in your computer but it provides smooth movement for the Bluetooth mouse.
