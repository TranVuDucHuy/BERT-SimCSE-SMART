Charging wise- it depends what you are charging. If I am charging an iPhone or a tablet, these plugs are on the slower side.Travel wise- these things are awesome. You already don’t have enough plugs in the hotel so these make it so you can actually charge everything. Doesn’t matter if the charge is slow if you charge things overnight.Value- you’re getting three plugs for 12 ish bucks so I’d say it’s a great price. I’ve probably bought about 20 of these things. Must have if you’re a tech person who needs more plugs, constantly in hotels or the office, or just want a cleaner set up.
