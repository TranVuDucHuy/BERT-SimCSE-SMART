sounds better than my $200 sound bar and has better volume control. perfect size for travel and easy to clean despite having the white colored speaker. don't waste your money on a cheaper speaker even if it is half the cost of this one; the quality is exponentially greater and worth the price. i'd pay $20 more for this speaker, but the price they ask for for this model 4 is such a steal since the model 5 is out now!
