I purchased this HDMI-to-HDMI cable to use with an HDMI splitter for my TV, enabling me to connect two separate devices such as a Chromecast device and DVD player to a single HDMI port. I only need a short cable for this purpose and this 3-foot cable does the job nicely. I like that to has plastic covers for each end of the cable in case I want to store or move it -- though once connected I doubt I'll do either. I haven't tested the transfer speed in the description but it seems to be more than adequate for videos. A good choice for the money.
