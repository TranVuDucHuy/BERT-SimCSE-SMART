The card being said from Amazon: was created for the Kindle Fire, but after you buy one, the proof is in the pudding!!!. There is so many options you find for this card after you install your: SanDisk 128 SD Memory Card to your KINDLE Fire. Besides all the options you will have, when you go to check out the card in your "Apps and Games" area after it's in, it has it's own area next to: downloaded app, then you will see "apps that can be movied to the SD Card" that's built right in so you want need a app to move things to your new card. It show you a list of the apps you have on your system that can be moved to SD card, or not. Some apps are not movable, and that's ok! The ones that are not able to move are not supposed to be moved for the reason, they need to read things out side of the card. Some give you options to move anyways, but will tell you that you will not be able to use widgets and other objects, etc, etc. Just don't get a SD App and try to force things in to the card that shouldn't be moved. I find also that my Kindle Fire is faster adding everything to the card, so that's a big plus, even my browser is faster, but we do use Chrome. The reason you hear that 1-to-2% having problems with this card besides coming to the realization after they buy a 128GB card, and see they could have bought a much smaller one since they had plenty of room to begin with. Most also are not waiting for the card to get everything lined up to work correct. Let me explain: Just like you should give time for the Kindle Fire to load correctly, also give your new card time to load, because besides it getting everything ready for you to use it, and carrying a ton of information at 128 GB, it's also checking to see if there are any other apps that need to be moved as it starts up, etc. It's not just a board with apps pinned to it, there is allot of information it is checking on, and also depends on where you added things from, so it can be checking allot of different areas too, thanks to Kindle Fires Åwesomeness!!! You can tell when it's ready, because the Icons on your desktop will turn dark to normal till it's ready to go, so don't be like the 1-to-2%, be smart, be patient!. Did you ever wonder why there are only a few who complain about objects we buy? Well besides they can't spell correctly? There the one who break things screwing around, because if they can't spell, there sure not going to read, and that makes them not patient enough and they think they must complain to get there money back. Being the CEO of "MUST HAVE" Åpps, and Supplies,™ we test ever item for a few weeks inside and out!. We add tons of info, then remove it all, just to add it back in again to see if the card is worthy enough 4Ü! We add all kinds of movies, docs, etc, then check to see how everything came out in the end. The more you use your card, and learn to 're-boot after your last app is installed for that day, the faster your card will be because it's lined up and clean with nothing to stop it. We are just like computers, they need to be rebooted after every download, and so does a Kindle Fire, it needs to be 're-booted after adding anything, and hard-booted if you ever have a problem. If you do not know this, you will be that 1-to-2% with problems because you never took time to read about your KINDLE Fire. That's the first two things you must learn besides cleaning your cache, and making sure you have no malware in your Kindle Fire. These four things are a "MUST" TO KNOW, and that way you can give great reviews too when done :-). Also, the reason we say this is for a: Kindle Fire 5TH Gen 10.1 is we tested this card on one. So those with a 5TH Gen who been looking to find the right 128 GB Micro Card, look no further!. Also, we do not get paid for our reviews, we started "MUST HAVE" for the people that are too busy in a day to wonder what the best is for there system, or the novice who wants what the pro's use. We take on all the testing for you, it's our way of giving back to the world. We have a major following and get hundreds of letters each week asking for reviews, but I tell them this: If we feel it does not make 5 star, and find the item has problems, we then will not leave a review, we will tell you instead what wrong with the product or app, and leave the review for another since we only do 5 Star items, and you know what? Most say: that's all we want, honesty!. There is always better out in the world of course, but this passed with flying colors and works great for me and my team!!! Most want to know what we use on our Kindle Fire's, and as far as Micro SD Cards go, this is it!!!..Remember always! Life is EZ! For those who SEEK!
