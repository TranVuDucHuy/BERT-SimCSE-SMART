I picked these up as backups, because I was using my Apple Pencils a LOT. I don't have a really abrasive screen protector on the iPads, which may be why my Pencil tips are lasting longer than expected. I haven't tried putting one of these tips on the existing Pencils to see if they work correctly, but it's an Apple product and I don't anticipate issues.
