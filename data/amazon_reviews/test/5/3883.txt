This wall mount is perfect for our large (83", 95lb) television. Easy to follow installation directions. Strong, well designed with excellent build quality means the mount easily handles the large TV. The mount can position the television about 6 in left or right from center - when I installed it the studs were not aligned with the center of the alcove and I was worried the TV would be off center but I was *wrong*! The available lateral positioning brought the TV back to near center of the alcove. Now my TV floats in front of the alcove wall! Thanks for a great product Echogear folks!
