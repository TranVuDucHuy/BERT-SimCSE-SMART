I've used this a couple times now to bypass problems with my work computers' wifi /wireless adapter. Working remote. When I get the problem in the past I was told I needed to be "landwired" in basically before The Helpdesk could do anything. This is why I got it, but I've found that just connecting with this, I guess "straightens the adapter out" on its own. Anyway this is the one I bought so that's why I like it. Just a happy end user, I can't recall what the item is named in general terms without looking up this order.
