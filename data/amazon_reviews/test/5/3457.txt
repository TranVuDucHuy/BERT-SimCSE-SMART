I ordered this with the idea of getting a family picture for our Christmas card. It was very reasonably priced and worth every penny. It is compact and folds down to a nice size that easy to tote. It is versatile with lots of options for height. It is easy to use and can be ready to go in a very short time. It does not seem flimsy or cheap considering the price we paid. We haven't used the remote as we use our watch to control the phone we attach.
