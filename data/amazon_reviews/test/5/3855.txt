Bought a set of these due to some bluetooth earbuds being completely frustrating in staying paired with each other that I also need to do a replace request with amazon... Assumed a headset would work better... and hey, it does.1. I like that it uses actual tactile buttons for volume, on/off. Haptic/touch sensitive controls are a big annoyance on things like this, because you adjust your headset or headphones and end up bumping the controls. JBL solves that problem with actual buttons.2. While not true noise cancelling, they're snug and loud with better than "good" sound quality to my ears. They're also comfortable.3. Easy pair to bluetooth with no issues.
