My wife doesn't always watch TV at the same time I do because she might be on the phone or computer while I'm watching TV. I learned the other day that the Dish Network Hopper 3 had Bluetooth capabilities so I took a chance and bought these earbuds which only talked about connecting with a mobile phone. I followed the simple instructions by charging the earbuds first then set the Hopper up for pairing per its instructions. then I pulled the earbuds out of the charging case per the instructions. The Dish Hopper instructions said to wait for the J51 earbuds (Bluetooth Headset) to appear in the pairing list (about 20 seconds), and select it which I did. The Dish Hopper had filled in the four-digit code of 0000 so I left that alone, clicked okay and it paired. Works flawlessly. I can't comment on any other features except volume control, which works as described. I ordered another set for my iPhone to see if the sound quality is as good as my iPods were before the batteries went bad in the earbuds.
