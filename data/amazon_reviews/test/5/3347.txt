Easy to mount. for me and my car, it is a great fit. But...It's a little flimsy if you want to do a lot of active interaction with the phone. But doing that is generally inadvisable and illegal.It's great for holding the phone where you can see it if you're using your phone for navigation, which is primarily why I bought it.It may obscure some of your dashboard displays, especially if your phone is tall, and your dash vents are high. In my car, the only thing it obscures is whether my lights are on. Easily mitigated with a slight glance around the phone.I guess the bottom line is, it's either great, or a slight annoyance, depending on your car's dashboard lay out. For me and my car, it's great! It does what it's supposed to do, just fine. And I've tried a bunch of other "phone holders" with no satisfaction. I'm throwing all the others away!
