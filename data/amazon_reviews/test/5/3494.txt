August 30, 2022 - things are still great and I just want to say despite getting other earbuds that do sound good such as the Soundpeats TrueAir 2's (semi in-ear buds) and two different pair of Lavabean earbuds that while bulky (they both have GREAT battery life, hence why they are big ... for the battery) that have a GREAT sound stage, but not as much "umph" to the overall sound as these T6's (I love both ... the Lavabeans and these T6's .. dont get me wrong) with the same V-shaped EQ I always apply ... overall these maybe my favorites ... Sure I have a pair of higher end Earfun buds that sound great, but there is something about the overall package (sound quality, battery, price ... esp on lightning deals that are far cheaper then those Earfuns) that I love about the T6's ... i go back and forth listening to different buds and when coming back to these T6's I am blown away by the sound ... there is even a good thump to the bass WHEN APPROPRIATE but it's clean and not "over the top" to my ears.I'd love to try (I DO have two pairs of TOZO NC2s which i love too) other TOZO models but i'd be questioning "should i just get a backup pair of T6s?" when considering the others.Do I even have to say that I still totally recommend these at this point?May 2, 2022 Update: things are still great ... no issues that, cleaning smunges and dirt/dust off the pin/where the pins connect, doesn't fix.I have been using my new Jlab Go Air Pop nightly instead of these and OVERALL I think the default tips make those feel better then the T6's ... doing an "A-vs-B' comparision wondering if the T6's really do sound better than the Go Air Pops ... YEAH... .The NC2's sound better than the T6's but the T6's definitly have a more "rich" sound than the Jlab Go Air Pop's (Jlab SIgnature EQ) I bought this past month. I already bought a pair of the T6's when they hit a super low ($4 lower than normal) lightning sale for a gift for someoneApril 1 2022 Update: after seeing the T6's $2.50 or so cheaper than the TYPICAL lightning deal, and in no time at all "80% claimed" i bought a second pair (still not sure if a gift for someone or a backup pair for myself) but despite liking the NC2's i STILL like the T6's as well ... I'd be interested in trying some of TOZO's other offerings.My only issue (and i admit i am waiting to hear back from TOZO support as i type this) is the warranty and how to register ... i feel "Process a Warranty" on the site is trying to USE it not simply registering it. I am a techie guy and i have registered warranties for products such as Tribits ... TOZO could just make it a little more clear on this front.Also something i found by accident ... and it makes sense that it's work in a way ... I usually use these when sleeping (they are good for sleeping though noting whatever side of my head faces the pillow DOESN'T have an earbud in it) ... I had'd been swapping them when i wake up and roll over ... however just using the same one in the OTHER ear works fine too.One thing I also noticed (not sure if it's the shape of my ears) is that the right earbud sometimes sound muffled if i use anything other than the shallow tips provided (they are more comfortable but you do lose a bit of base) ... the solution is to "pinch" the right earbud to not trigger the touchpad and just pull out "a hair" .. just bairly and that clears that up .. .it doesn't happen with default NC2 tips ... just specifically the T6's and only in my right ear with non-shallow tips when i first put them in---------------------------------------------Another update: The only issue i have is for a gift for someone i am trying to decide if these or say a pair of TOZO's NC2's would be better for them. (BOTH GREAT OPTIONS) ... I have still used these mainly for my side-sleep, and only using which bud/ear is not facing the pillow to help me sleep and these have great passive NC and they are comfortable for this use too. Heck ... I am not (I already picked up a second pair of the NC2's i was so impressed, to have for myself) against picking up another pair of the T6's (though i'd like to try some of the other models too) to have a "backup" pair of these too.I do admit sometimes just to get the perfect fit i swap eartips (nothing that causes me pain with one pair or the other, just trying to dial things in) from time to time ... but I am HIGHLY impressed with these. I do admit on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet I think I have seen the NC2s and the T6's getting the "highest reviews' vs some of the other TOZO models.Update: using these regularly, including some times sleeping (where they are on for hours, just swapped in single use mode when i wake up and roll over) and to be honest .... I have only charged them twice and the last time I did, I couldn't even remember how long it was since the first time i charge them was. it had to be almost 2 weeks and possibly a few hours (and topped off as I swap them using them for sleep music)I still think the NC2's sound better (maybe my favorite buds or tied with the Earfun Free Pro 2's) .. but that is just how good the NC2's sound .... these T6's still sound GREAT to me and ... I'd not be against picking up a backup pair of these in case the price goes up, just like I got a backup pair of NC2's ... I am IMPRESSED by TOZO ... I JUST HOPE These buds last (not saying they are haviing issues ...to be clear)I am totally happy with my purchase---------------------------These Tozo T6’s are ones I picked up after seeing how highly they were rated. I have to admit I am not sure what I expected … I mean some “OMG they are the best” reviews on any products sort of make me think they are over-exaggerating, but having said that, these really have impressed me.I am new to BT earbuds but so far I have a number of pairs of buds, includingBluetooth Earbuds I have are TOZO NC2’s, Earfun’s Free Pro 2’s and the Earfun Free Mini’s, Fiil’s T1XS with app support, and Edifier’s TWS1 Pros.It’s going to be too hard right now to compare the sound but I can roughly do it … the fact that I haven’t played with the TWS1 Pro’s a lot (I do love them, for the record) and say the Fiil’s I can judge the sound on, but they have an app with custom EQ settings. I also have to note I do not have any of these for calls … I just cant judge them on that front … listening to music, and watching videos (Youtube, TV shows and movies) on various devices is my main use case.-------------------------------------------Thing to remember:Remember the sound and comfort part is based on a number of things and getting the right ear tip for you, is key … too small and they (ANY earbud) may feel like they fall out easy and in some cases the base of an earbud isn’t as strong “as it should be “ .. too big and not only will you have discomfort, but in my experience the base may seem to be “too much”. The sound insulation (aka passive noise canceling) is really dependent on you getting a good seal in your ear and that means the proper tips … some of this IS trial and error to see which ones are the best for you/--------------------------------------------------------Presentation/Unboxing - The presentation and unboxing is not something that blows me away in most cases … if it’s one of those “small brown box with not a lot of printing on it” type boxes .. that’s cool with me. Having said that … I am IMPRESSED. The unboxing of these (AND the NC2s for that matter) shows that “the company cares” … I expected a “meh” experience at worst … but there is something about the unboxing and how everything is together that makes me feel “oh … they went above and beyond here… nice”.--------------------------------------------Sound – This may not be the TOP priority (I mean if they don’t feel good, it doesn’t matter how they sound) but it’s UP THERE for me, near #1. I expected a reasonably good sound but nothing “over the top”. My expectations were more of what I have heard from the Earfun Free Mini’s … good enough and great at times… but just missing a richness (the best way I can describe it). While I have heard better, these T6’s sound a lot better than that description.Before I go further about the sound I totally admit no matter the wired/wireless earbud/headphone I use , I usually have an EQ on … a mix between a U and a V type setting … Bass raised and Treble raised a bit but not a “sharp V” shaped EQ profile … just have to be clear on this.The sound on these may not please a true audiophile but I AM IMPRESSED. Everything lows, mids and highs, are “right where they need to be” and even the punchy base in some rap tracks is clean sounding … the base in my testing does NOT bleed into the mids, making the things sound “muddy” as some people may have seen it described. These have a punchy base at times but it’s not over the top by any means and that is how I like it.Another thing is that things do not sound as wide as some other headphones/earbuds I have heard but still things are not “crammed together” … things in my tests of Jazz, Classic, Rock (typically hard rock, but regular rock too) and Rap … there is room for everything to “breath” sound wise, if that makes sense. I HATE TO over-blow how great the sound is … I mean there are better more expensive options, but these T6 sound a lot better than I was expecting. I have only one other TOZO (though I’d love to try more) product in the NC2’s and I can see why so many LOVE the T6’s. I am not trying to say these are the most “wide” sounding when it comes to sound-stage but they are by no means the most “narrow” either. I like them the way they are.---------------------------Comparison/Comments about two TOZO products – These T6’s vs The NC2’s -Before I go further since I just mentioned the TOZO NC2’s … THEY ARE an improvement to the T6s .. I love the T6’s do not get me wrong but the sound is just that much crisper and cleaner .. the base IS better on the NC2’s vs the T6’s and … I have “no issue” with the T6 sound. It’s what I love about the T6 … made better, sound wise.If you like this form factor better over the NC2’s stem style design … may be the NC9s or NC7s would be right for you.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------PASSIVE Noise Canceling – I have to say I am IMPRESSED with the passive NC these provide with the “right earbud tips”. I mean I do have to say the NC2’s ACTIVE NC is great and I love it but, these provide far more NC passively than I was expecting .. I ALSO know what ANC in this price range is… I do not expect ANC to “cancel everything out” … even when it say comes to higher end Sony Earbuds.The Tozo T6’s provide GREAT passive noise cancellation with no audio on, however once there is say music playing … things are just drowned out. I have a black Honeywell fan near me, that is on most of the time and when I have the T6’s in and the fan on …. when music is on, I BARELY hear the fan at all. The NC2’s ANC cancels out noise like that VERY WELL, do not get me wrong, but I am just shocked how well the T6’s work blocking noise out when they do not even have ANC.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Comfort – OF COURSE this is all based on getting the right eartip as I have said before, but after some trials of different sized tips to at least see what the smaller or bigger ones are like …. I have what I like dialed on. I do admit it may be a bit of an issue for some to swap tips (my advise … flip the part of the tip that would be touching your ear around, so you can see the part that goes on the earbud and pull … same thing with putting the new ear tips on… so you can see what you are doing) but once you get the hang of it, it’s easy and … it DOES matter overall …. if the tips are too big they may hurt your ears so it doesn’t matter if they sound good, you will not like your earbuds then.These are also earbuds that I have tried when going to sleep and I have NOT had any discomfort with them. I do “side-sleep” and they are no issue, though I admit in that case I use them one at a time with whatever side of my head faces down, NOT having an earbud in… I wake up and before I turn over I swap the buds… I just know my head on the pillow will trigger the touch controls and doing this method of swapping buds, I have done before with WIRED earbuds … no problem for me.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Build Quality – I am not going to go overboard and say how TOZO uses premium quality products here, but at the same time note how the build quality is another place where TOZO REALLY impresses me .. with the T6’s they (the buds AND the case) do NOT feel cheap or like corners were cut. I am not saying the case feels “heavy” or anything but there is just a feeling that things are well made … this may be my favorite case among the group of earbuds I mention having. Not saying it’s the smallest but the hinge does not flop shut on it’s own like some others do.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Controls – These seem decent and I have not had issues when I use them, though I have to be transparent .. I have these paired with an Android TV box, my Firestick 2nd Gen and my laptop. Even when I use them, I am not always using the touch controls.-----------------------------------------------Battery Life – I cant say I have had this long enough to really test this vs what is advertised but I am happy with the performance I have experience------------------------------------Con – This is so picky and I don’t care to be honest but there is a voice that tells you they are connected for example .. the issue is when you put the second bud in, there will be say a “connected” over what you are listening to … I have HEARD that is annoying when on a phone call and say swapping buds.. that “connected” from the earbuds over what the other person is saying … I HESITATE to even mention this as a con. BARELY a slight annoyance to me though I admit I do not use these for phone calls… It’s just something I’d like to mentionAnother thing that is picky … the earbuds when taken out of the case have to be flipped around before putting them in your ear … this seems so silly of a thing to mention but the earbud part that has the eartip faces inside of the case and the part that sticks out of your ear is on the outside … that’s all well and good but it does takes muscle memory to always remember to flip them around when taking them out of the case.---------------------------------SummaryI am sure I am forgetting comments I wanted to make but, I DO RECOMMEND the Tozo T6’s, without hesitation .. only having one other TOZO product the NC2’s … I do admit they have the sound I love about the T6’s I love and have improved it. I would not hesitate to recommend either T6s or NC2’s (what many consider the two best TOZO models) to people
