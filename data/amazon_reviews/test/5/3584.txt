This is the first time I've purchased a ring light. I just opened a web store for my handmade knitted and crocheted projects and needed help with the images. When I took the photo using my iPhone, the colors were not coming out but with the light, now I can show the true colors. Easy to assemble, easy to set up the remote and very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. Would definitely recommend.
