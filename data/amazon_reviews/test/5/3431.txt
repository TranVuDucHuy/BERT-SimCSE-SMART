Love this mount, It was super easy to install myself, and following the instructions was a breeze. fits most TVs and when it comes time to hang it up it locks into place very sturdy and is easy to adjust from side to side. Has room for a bit of tilt but not too much. Should be hung slightly above eye level when sitting down or laying down for best results. The straps can be hidden by tucking them up and over the bracket from under the tv. Holds my 55 inch with no issues and is not visible at all
