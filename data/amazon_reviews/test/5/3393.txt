Got this for my 8yo to use with her iPad. She has enjoyed using it! We downloaded the sketchbook app as per recommendation and it works great with that. She tried it with a coloring app where you tap a spot for the app to fill that spot with a color and the pen didnâ€™t work as well with a single tap, it would work some times and not others. It must prefer to be used for actual drawing or writing.
