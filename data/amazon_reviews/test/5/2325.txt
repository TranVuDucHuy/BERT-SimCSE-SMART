I am an iPhone gal and I tried AirPods, of course. But after losing them repeatedly, I thought I'd try something more affordable so I got these. Because the price is so low, I think nothing about buying GoAirPops for my friends. Here are the benefits:- With the Apple product, if you take one of them out of your ear, the one in your hand stops playing. With the GoAirPops, if I can't find one or both of the pair, I play white noise or whatever to my paired AirPops and I can hear them and find them right away. Easy.- The Apple product just falls out too easily. Repeatedly re-purchasing the Apple product gets old fast. I find the GoAirPops actually stay in my ear! Shock! You would think the geniuses at Apple would have made that a priority but...- The Apple product gets waxy and gross pretty quickly. But the GoAirPops are like rubber and are a lot more comfortable.- The Apple product has a "feature" that reduces ambient noise so whenever anyone wants to say something to you, you have to remove an AirPod to hear what they are saying. There are even instructions online about how to defeat this "feature" by going to their settings etc. It is common knowledge that being outside without being able to hear ambient sound is dangerous. Bike riders, skaters, and joggers are warned to be able to be aware of their surroundings. So I see this as a safety feature that the GoAirPops are not blocking out all noise. Even when you are at home, it is not safe to block out your family, or other sounds in your home.
