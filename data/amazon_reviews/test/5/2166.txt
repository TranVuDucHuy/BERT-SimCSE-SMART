I have struggled to use any kind of in-ear headphone my whole life. I have been under the mistaken impression that my ear canals were quite small because I would try and put things into them and it would always feel like they just didn't fit. I purchased this pair of earbuds because reviews said that they tended to run small and I thought my problem was that I had small canals. But that was exactly wrong. In truth I have large ear canals so much so that I have been trying to put connectors into my ears and nothing is held and then I've ended up trying to actually jam the whole bud into the canal. So instead of using the smallest tips that came with these, I found that using the largest tip actually gave me for the first time a snug seal. Unfortunately my left ear is apparently a little bit bigger than my right and the left keeps trying to fall out though the right stays snug. I'm going to attempt to find a third party alternate tip that is even bigger than the one it comes with. So if your problem is with fit apparently this model does run a little small but it does come with three different tips that you can try. I found the use and the Bluetooth connection to be very solid. There have been no issues with battery life or playback stability. In order for the best sound to be obtained you need the snug fit of the tip so I will typically find that the sound is great when I first put them in but as soon as I've been a little bit active the seal tends to break on my left ear and then I can tell I'm not getting quite as good as sound. I can only have the lefty in about for 5 minutes at a time so these are not perfect but they're good for what they are.
