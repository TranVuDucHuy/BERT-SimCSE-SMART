Ok… ok… once soon a time I was frustrated and lonely and my toner ran out right when I had to print something out (it’s always that way though… think about it), anyway… I go over to the printer and with fuming disgust I YANK my toner shell out of that good for nothing printer and begin wrenching it like a crazed monkey holding a bottle that’s swallowed his banana! And right then and there, like you couldn’t get it to happen again if you TRIED!… the toner cartridge BUSTED in my primate palms and poof! Yes POOF! The toner that was left (that’s right, not completely empty just MOSTLY empty), it covers me in residual black clouds of disdain the likes of Wylie Coyote Acme TNT.After yelling “NNOOOOOOOooooOooo!” I began to laugh like a funny farm member at lunch.Well, this toner is not like that one… this toner actually works and does not retaliate when it’s replaced, unlike El Presidente de Coup Biden.In other words… buy it and you’ll actually get what you need and expect. Boom
