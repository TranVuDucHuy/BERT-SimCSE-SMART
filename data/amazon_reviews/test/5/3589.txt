When purchasing items in preparation for the arrival of my Nintendo Switch, this product was highly recommended. Like a first time parent, I was doing lots research, spending, and very excited of my new arrival. I thought I had to only buy Nintendo licensed microSD's only for the Switch to save/load games properly but that's not the case. Anyways, the micro SD works and was easy to insert into my Switch OLED. *whispers* You can also buy the regular SanDisk microSD cards without the Nintendo logo; get more space for your buck ^_~
