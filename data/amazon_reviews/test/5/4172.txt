I had a cable running straight from port to pc and it was getting in the way (I just rearranged the room) as it wasn't long enough to be routed all against the wall. I purchased this to fix that and no drop in download or upload speed and tested multiple times. There isn't a reason you shouldn't buy this if you're looking for an ethernet cable long enough for your needs.UPDATE 12/27After a week of using this, I am experiencing internet drops not by download or upload speed but it'll disconnect me from my internet completely and all my browser tabs, games, and discord will try to reconnect or D/C me. I resorted to my old CAT6 cable I've been using and have had no similar hiccups. I will be returning this and purchasing a cable from a trustworthy retailer even if it means spending $50+. I'd much rather spend more money on a quality cable than a cheap one that only 'does the job'.UPDATE #2 (1/31)After I had already cable managed this cable, I decided I’d give it another shot before returning. It turns out my ISP was not keeping up to date with their service outages and problems that were occurring as mentioned from my previous update. Since using this cable from probably about 1/10, I can confirm to have no problems and have full download and upload speeds that I’m paying for. Like in my initial review, it is bang for your buck and works like a charm.
