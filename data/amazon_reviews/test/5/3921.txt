I got these primarily for traveling on airplanes, and they work amazingly well for that purpose. They bring the noise down to a super low level, and once you start playing pretty much anything through them, it pretty much completely overpowers the sound of the plane.Despite getting them primarily for travel, I use them a lot in my day to day life as well. They're quite comfortable, especially around the ears.The bluetooth range is excellent, the battery life is phenomenal, and you can even use a wired connection if the battery runs out(although sadly, this takes the noise cancellation with it).They seem quite durable, but also come with a nice carrying case, making damage even less of a concern.My one small issue with them is that rather than being controlled with physical buttons, they use touch sensors, which are much easier to accidentally set off when adjusting your hair, leaning on your hands, etc...
