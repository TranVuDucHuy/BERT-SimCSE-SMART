These are my favorite true wireless earbuds for the money, but they aren't without their quirks.This is my second time buying these because they are so comfortable and have everything I want in a pair of headphones. You can usually find them on sale for a little less than $40 and they are 100% worth it.My first pair was worn 30 - 40 hours a week for almost a year before the in-ear sensor in the right earbud started bugging out, playing and pausing when it was in my ear.I highly recommend these despite their flaws, and I have seen them make improvements between my first and second pair, notably you can now cycle through ANC, Transparency, and ANC off.Pros:Comfortable - I work as a custodian and wear earbuds for 6 - 10 hours a day and these are by far the MOST comfortable ones I've ever owned. My ears never hurt no matter how long I keep them in and they STAY PUT whether I'm dangling them over a toilet or bending down to pick up something of the floor. I've never had these come out of my ear or feel like they are slipping out of position.Battery life - these have great battery life, often lasting 6 or 7 hours with ANC. I want something that can last all day so I can focus on my work and block out the annoying noises of vacuums and rolling trash bins. They can also be used independently, so when the battery does get low and I don't need the ANC, I'll pop one in the case for 15 min to get more out of them.Wireless charging - I just put them down on my charging pad when I get home and they're ready to go the next morning.Active noise cancelling - the ANC is GREAT, automatically blocking out the worst noises including multiple different vacuums (which each produce different annoying frequencies) and the surprisingly loud sounds of empty rolling trash bins and rolling trash cans.Sound quality - I'm not an expert on earbud sound quality, but I AM a part-time sound tech who mixes for live worship so I have some experience training my ear to know what sounds good. I think these sound good! I never get tired of listening with these and I feel like the music reproduction is pretty darn good! No EQ needed like with my JBL live free nc+ earbuds.The case - the size of the case is compact and fits great in my pocket.Cons:The case - this is my second time buying this model and the case seems to have been "updated" (or perhaps cost-cut) and now the hinge seems...floppy. Not too bad, but not as stiff and sturdy-feeling as the old one. The hinge has more "wiggle" than I'd like, and the older version didn't have any. The new case is glossier and retains fingerprints more than the old one which was nice and matte. The case can feel a little slippery in the hand, although I usually keep it in my pocket.It also has this annoying issue with wireless charging where it won't stop charging when it's full on battery. My JBL Live Free NC+ earbuds will stop when fully charged. Additionally, when I remove my headphones from the wireless charging pad, without even opening the case they will connect to my phone. I've remedied this by just opening and closing the lid whenever I take my headphones off the charger, but this SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. It also means that if the power goes out while they are on the wireless charger that will automatically connect to my phone (often in the middle of the night). Hopefully it will be fixed in subsequent versions.All-in-all, the pros outweigh the cons (significantly, in my opinion). I think these are an amazing option for the $40 price point and I have been very pleased with their reliability and performance. I hope this new pair will also last another 1,600 hours or more. If Tozo solves the issues with wireless charging and goes back to the old case design (firm, sturdy hinge and matte finish) while keeping them at an affordable price then these would be undisputably the best possible earbuds I could imagine.
