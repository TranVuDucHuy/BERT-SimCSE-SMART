Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 23-year-old. His girlfriend was really judgey about it asking why anyone would pay for it when you can just use stuff you have at home... until my son proceeded to clean his AirPods right there at the kitchen table. I'll spare y'all, I couldn't bring myself to take pics, it was absolutely revolting. I'm sure another reviewer has some you can look at, trust me when I say this was one of the most impressive cheap purchases I've made in a long time. Gets a big recommend from the person who got it and myself!
