This product will get your phone positioned exactly the way you want it with near infinite adjustability. It’s not the most stable shooting Dash video as it jiggles a fair amount, but once on glass, it stays there. In fact, if it’s left on for a long time, it can become very hard to remove. Unfortunately, the suction pad is not individually replaceable, which would be nice but would probably increase the price, which is currently an excellent value. Mine was damaged when I tried to move it to another vehicle. The company replaced the whole unit even though it was several years old at no cost to me.
