Ordered these headphones two months ago when they released. I'm a pretty serious cyclist and I have used these nearly daily for my rides, which last anywhere from two to six hours. I also live in a tropical part of the US, so I tend to sweat a lot.Before these earbuds, I was using Shure wired earbuds for my rides. Those earbuds were not necessarily meant for my type of training, especially when I sweat as much as I do when I ride. I landed on the Bose SoundSports for their proposed protection from sweat and their earbud design. I have used Bose SoundSports a couple of generations ago and I always preferred their emphasis on fitting the concha of the ear as opposed to the traditional inner ear canal fit.Pros -* The fit is quite comfortable for me. I cannot stand traditional IEMs for their extremely uncomfortable fit (just my opinion), especially if I plan on using them for several hours straight. The size earbud I chose is close to the original SoundSports I used four years ago. After a couple of rides, I could hardly feel them. The tight fit also prevents any wiggle room or potential for falling out, so when I'm in the drops or sprinting I'm not concerned at all about these running away.* They are not completely sound-proof, which is great for me when I need to listen to traffic and other people while riding. This means I can start a ride wearing these and not have to take them off other than to talk to people and to take breaks.* The automation is really useful actually. Automatically detecting when the right earbud has left my ear to pause music, then detecting when I put it back on to resume music is probably my favorite of this aspect. Answering calls by putting on the earbud is okay too, but in reality by the time you open the case and put on the earbud (plus the time it takes to connect to your device) your incoming call has probably already ended. But, going back to the first bit of automation, there's honestly no better feeling than riding up to a friend, taking out the right earbud, and stopping your music with little to no effort. I'm sure other earbuds do this too, but I'm new to the true wireless scene.* The touch controls make riding without pulling out your phone an easy feat. The option to skip tracks with a double-tap on the left bud, play/pause with a double tap on the right bud, and now a swipe up or down to adjust the volume all help me keep my attention on the road.* The call quality is amazing, according to everyone I call while wearing these. I speak softly and mumble sometimes out of habit, but these earbuds adjust and pick up even the softest of rumblings I might mutter. They also amplify my voice enough to be heard by everyone involved in a call, thus improving my ability to articulate points beyond belief. These earbuds have made it into my daily carry because of this.* So far, these have been completely impervious to sweat. I'm almost afraid that I'm going to break them in time because since buying them two months ago I have not had a need to clean them in any way (besides the actual rubber earbuds). Hopefully, these will continue to resist all the sweat I throw at them (which is a lot considering that I wear jawbreaker glasses and have helmet straps pooling sweat around my ear).* The battery life is strong and perfect for my use. Since my typical training ride lasts anywhere from 1:45 to 2 hours, I never have to worry about battery life. Even during my extra long rides, I can very easily take a break from my music, let them charge for 30 or so minutes, and continue my ride without care for battery life at all.In-betweeners -* The sound quality is a bit more trebly than the Shure earbuds I used. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for me. I definitely don't mind more or less bass than usual. Some people might choose against these for this reason.* Being a Bluetooth device, the connection between the earbuds and your device cannot always be perfect. I went from using wired to wireless and I had to learn this the hard way. I believe it's a fact of life for me now, but this is something that will only get better with time (I hope). Intermittently, my music will cut in and out as if I'm getting a call, then resume as normal. My phone also seems to be the culprit with a lot of other Bluetooth issues. Using IP voice comm apps like Teams or Discord will cause the microphone to produce this "shrill noise". I can work around this by using those apps on my work phone instead, so I definitely don't blame the earbuds at all for this. Otherwise, the call quality is excellent.* These are very reliant on the Bose app. Because I am just getting into the latest generation of Bose products, I was really unaware of this aspect before buying the earbuds. Not saying this would've deterred me, but it does make joining the product to other devices a little more complicated. It's definitely possible to connect these earbuds to your phone without the Bose app, but doing so makes you lose out on all of the extra functionality and the earbuds play at a much lower volume than they're capable of with the Bose app.Cons-* Taking calls with these earbuds while riding a bike is not possible. The wind blasting into the microphones renders them completely useless during calls, so every call I get (depending on the urgency) will require me to pull over and take a break. This happens at speeds as low as 10-15 mph, so really these cannot function for calls whatsoever while riding a bike.* While I praised the fit initially, in the beginning, I did have issues finding the perfect size earbud for me. The type of earbud has changed from the earlier generations of Bose SoundSports to now, so I did have a hard time adapting to the different fit. My ears were a bit sore in the beginning, but, as I said before, I eventually adapted and now I can hardly tell I'm wearing them.There's honestly not a whole lot more I can say about these earbuds. This is all just off the top of my head... All in all, these earbuds have out-preformed in almost every way I expected. I bought them really only to listen to music on my rides without being burdened with a wire, and now I can't imagine not using them daily for calls and such.
