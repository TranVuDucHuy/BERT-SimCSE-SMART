They're comfortable, sound good, and I've had no issues with them moving or falling out of my ears. I trail run and mountain climb, so I go hard.I've had one bad experience where I took them out of my ears, put them into their case, and they didn't disconnect. I got a phone call and it took me a second to figure out why I couldn't hear the person on my phone. Now, I manually disconnect them by turning off my phones bluetooth before putting them into their case. A minor annoyence, but overall they're great.
