I've been falling in love with this set of earbuds from TOZO. Get it. You won't regret it!It's not the cheapest nor as expensive as the Apple Airpods Pro earbuds at $250. But its functions are almost identical to the AirPods Pro.ANCThe best feature of the NC2 is its active noise canceling function. I've compared its ANC capability with my Airpods Pro by doing my "bathroom test." My first-floor bathroom has a very noisy fan on the ceiling. It's the best place to do an ANC test in the house. I can barely hear the fan on my Airpods Pro with the ANC on. If Airpods Pro is a 10 on a 1-to-10 effectiveness scale (10 being most effective), I would give TOZO NC2 a close 9. I was pleasantly surprised since I liked how it sounds, and wanted it to have a good ANC feature!The ANC is turned on and off by the touch-sensitive button on the outer casing. One-touch on the left earbuds turns it on and doing that again turn off the ANC and turns on the TRANSPARENCY mode. Any touch-sensitive button can be misread by the device (perhaps this is why Apple did not use a touch-sensitive feature on its Airpods Pro). But I found an effective way to turn on and off the features on the NC2's--to turn on the ANC mode, touch the left earbud's button (outer casing) and keep it pressed for a fraction a second, then take your finger off. This is a sure way to make the device read it as a 1-touch command (and not a 2-touch command) in order to turn on the ANC or the TRANSPARENCY mode. I do the same on the right earbud (which is for forwarding to the next song).TRANSPARENCY ModeA good set of earbuds with a good ANC feature should also have an effective transparency mode. And it does. Once it's on, I can hear everything around me when I'm on a walk around the neighborhood with my dog. But there's one aspect of the NC2's transparency mode that's not as good as the AirPods Pro--it's when it's windy outside. I was on a walk around the neighborhood with my dog, and the wind was about 16 mph. Hissing sound of the wind was noticeable. But when the wind is below 10 mph (which is typical in my area), there's no hissing sound. So, when I'm on a Costco or Target run, I take my NC2's. On a very windy day going for a walk, I take my Airpods Pro or my TOZO T5 Sport (that has an ear hook that's great for walking and running).SOUNDI love the bass on the NC2's. It's punchy and boomy (when the music warrants it). But the bass is not so pronounced like my T12's that are designed for bass lovers. The NC2's give you a nice balance of the bass, the mids, and the highs. I would say its sound is close to the TOZO NC9's.CONNECTIONWhen you open the case on the NC2, your paired device will display: "TOCO NC2 Connected." That's what I get on my iPhone 8. So, the connection is immediate.DISTANCEWith my NC2 earbuds on (and playing music) I walked 2 rooms away (separated by walls--not an open concept floor plan) from my iPhone 8. The connection was great; there was no flickering or cutting out at all. I was quite impressed by the earbuds' ability to maintain the connection!ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT (This is for TOZO)I have medium-sized hands (they're always dry), and it's not easy to take out the earbuds from the case--notably, this difficulty occurs with earbuds that are designed with a stem, like the Apple Airpods Pro. I have a slightly easier time taking out my Airpods Pro from its case as compared to the NC2's. Yet, earbuds that are not designed with a stem, like the TOZO T12, the T10, and the NC9, are WAY easier to take out of the case than my Airpods Pro. So, earbuds with a stem have this typical issue. My recommendation to TOZO is if at all possible, to use a more grippy plastic or design the earbuds to be more grippy somehow. This issue is not a deal-breaker, but if I were at the helm of TOZO, I would focus on this as one of the features to improve on the NC2's going forward.CONCLUSION: NC2's are my go-to earbuds at home, in the office, and on a Target run, hands down. I only use my Apple Airpods Pro on a very windy day out on a walk with my dog. Right now, that seems to be the only time I am pulling out my Airpods Pro's--all other occasions pull me toward my NC2's!
