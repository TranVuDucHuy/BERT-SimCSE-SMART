You will definitely enjoy this if you have a rat's nest near your bedside. That's the problem it solved for us. The charger is 3 in 1, and looks sleek. I would say the feel is sturdy and it looks real nice next to your tidy nightstand. It works well with most cases, but certainly the ones with the magnetic piece on the back (MagSafe). I don't have the Ultra iWatch, so I don't know if there is a slowdown in how well it charges it, however, our iOS watches had no issue. *WE DID HAVE A PROBLEM, where the charger no longer charged the watch, however the seller made it very easy for us to solve the problem. 5-star service, for sure. We are very happy with this purchase.
