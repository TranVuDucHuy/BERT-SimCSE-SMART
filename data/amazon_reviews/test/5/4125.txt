I've only had these for a day but I've worn them a LOT. I wore them all day yesterday, I even wore them to bed. I do wish the charge was for longer, and that I could wander a little further from my computer when paired, but they're wireless so I wasn't expecting those things to be great. I basically forgot these were on. The little charging box they come with is really neat. The only issue I have is that they are noise canceling enough that when I try to talk with them in, I can hear myself loud. But I can still hear other people perfectly. I think they've been blocking out the annoying noises throughout the day even when they're dead? But the sound quality is as good as the over-earmuff Skullcandy headphones I got recently that were overheating my ears. My husband wants a pair now, so he can wear them at work.
