This works great ! I originally had it up on the dash but the phone was too heavy and it would not stay. I then moved it down below by the gear shifter in the center column and it fit perfectly, was not intrusive, able to charge and glance at if needed! I especially like the two buttons on each side that have springs that open up the holder and then snap shut, cradling the phone snuggly! Then press then again to open it up to remove the phone! Not like other models I have had where it is hard to get the phone in and out of the cradle! This really was a great buy but you have to find a spot or possibly Velcro it down if you have it up on your dash !
