I initially purchased the Beats Pro version but found them to be slightly too large for my ears and not secure enough for running and exercise as they kept falling out. I then switched to the over-the-neck version (Flex) for sports and am pleased to report that they fit much better in my ears and stay securely in place.The noise cancellation on the Pro version was excellent, so I decided to get the Studio, which seems slightly smaller in size - a good fit for small ears. I've included a picture to show how the earbuds fit in my ears (they stick out slightly, but not too much).I've chosen not to include technical details in this review as they are well-covered in other reviews. From my experience, I found the generic reviews about the product's technical quality to be accurate.
