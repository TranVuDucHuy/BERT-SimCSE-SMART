A year or two ago we got both our kids Amazon tablets for Christmas. With that said, we have some how broken one charger and then some how lost the only working charger! I found these and jumped on ordering them! They are wonderful for the price!!! They are a lot longer than the ones that came with them, but seem like they will hold up longer. Great buy!
