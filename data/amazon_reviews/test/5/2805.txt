Outstanding reliability! I stuck this in my dashcam 3.5 years ago and rarely think about it. It records constantly when the car is on, but for the first 2.5 years it recorded 24/7 until my dashcam started draining my car battery.It has never had an issue and I've only reformatted it a handful of times as the dashcam recommends doing it regularly, but never because of an issue. Every once in awhile I check it to make sure it's still working probably and it has never skipped a beat.Buying a couple more today for home cameras. Every other brand I've had, has failed completely after a few months to a year, or had issues with not being recognized by device or losing data - requiring reformatting on occasion. Even a couple sandsisks that were lower end cards have had issues.This card has had the most activity and abuse with no issues, even during outside temperatures ranging from near 0F to 105F. Definitely recommend!
