This ring light is probably my best Amazon purchase ever. The quality is far beyond what I expected. Anyone who has given this product less than 5 stars.. I just don't get it. A review had mentioned the phone holder only took vertical video and wasn't adjustable however, the description of the product from the seller said otherwise. I decided to video how the phone holder is absolutely yes... adjustable. The quality for the money is outstanding. I would have expected to pay $100+ for quality like this. Big üëç from me!
