It was easy to put in the phone, But the actual tray that holds it is very bendy. Be careful sliding the tray out, So you can remember how the Original Chip is (face up or down) both old and new chip go on same tray. I have sausage fingers so if I can do it you can... It does "sort of" clip in position in Tray before you slide it in so dont just jam it in, look for the fitIt also comes with a MICRO SD adapter, I dint need it but if you want to use it in a camera or Computer slot I suppose that is what you would use,It was automatically recognized by phone as memory. But you have to pull up apps in your phones settings and go through them, some apps ask if you want to move them to the new memory but most I copied and pasted from the phones file menu to the new memory card.Turn off phone before removing the Tray
