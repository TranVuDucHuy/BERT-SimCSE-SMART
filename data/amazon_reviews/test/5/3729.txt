Bought for a birthday party setup. Definitely not as sturdy outside where I used it but it was uneven grass. It’s a very light product and I didn’t not use the sandbags so that’s prob why it felt a bit less sturdy while I used it outside. It was super easy to set up and indoors if felt like it would be pretty sturdy. 5/5
