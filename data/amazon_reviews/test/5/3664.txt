As for this cable, it’s the typical Apple cable. I expect it to last 1 to 2 years. 3 at most. apple’s cables are made to wear out soon so that they can get more sales. They have the ability to make better cables but they don’t and anyone who makes the same cable follows Apple’s lead. In all aspects, it feels and seems to be the real cable.
