I use these with my Fire HD10 in bed to allow me to listen to stuff without disturbing my wife who is usually watching TV. Only issue I get intermittently is with the buds failing to connect with the tablet every time. I don't know which end is at fault but I suspect the tablet rather than the buds as it had trouble with previous BT headphones. I can't comment on the phone interface as I don't use it but for casual listening these are ideal and cost effective. The case is really designed to slip out of you hands and there is little by way of a clue as to which side opens in the dark. kurdene roughen up your case and put a lip on the side that opens.
