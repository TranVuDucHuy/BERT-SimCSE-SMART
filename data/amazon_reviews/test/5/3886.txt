I was somewhat concerned about mounting an 85 inch TV on a wall where I couldn't use a studfinder (wall is covered by barn wood). After doing some careful probing, I installed the wall bracket and, with some help, mounted the TV to the bracket. The included bolts were long enough to get a firm grip in the studs, even through the extra 1/4" barn wood. Instructions were perfectly clear and included bolts and spacers for a variety of different TV's. I like it so much I got another for a smaller TV.
