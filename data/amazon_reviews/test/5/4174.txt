OK, so I didn't rate how good the WiFi Signal that Amazon would like me to rate, because, well, this isn't WiFi...For Gaming? Um, 5 stars I guess, as if you are using a hard-wired cable instead of WiFi your response times will be better....For working out? Amazon? Seriously? Ok, let me try:This cable could be used as a jump rope, it is 100' long, so you could either double it up, or move along it and keep jumping for hours and never have to jump the same place more than a few times before shifting to another part of the cable.... You could use it for a tug-of-war to help you build up some strength? You might use it to fix your weight machine if the cable that holds the weights breaks? So, Sure Amazon, 5 stars for working out? It is also good for ... OK, well...It works Excellently as an...... Ethernet cable!and at 100' you can connect it to your router at one end of the house, and plug it into a computer at the other end. in my case, my WiFi was spotty and I needed to fix that ASAP, and this was shipped and got here the next day or so.I also like the flat cable aspect, but mostly I like that it worked and worked well.
