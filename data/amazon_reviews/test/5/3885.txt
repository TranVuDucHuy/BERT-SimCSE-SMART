While this mount isn't the highest rated for folding flat to the wall, it's range of motion is awesome. Works perfectly for pulling the TV out and angling so it can be seen from across the room. I needed a long extension and large angle so my 65" TV could be watched from the pool table. This is built very sturdy and doesn't wobble or bend down when extended. Just what I needed!
