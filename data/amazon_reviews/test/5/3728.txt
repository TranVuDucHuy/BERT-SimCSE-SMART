Bought the stand for my daughters first birthday next month. Had to try everything out before, just in case I needed to return something. But thankfully I donâ€™t have to return this! It was easy to set up you can make it full width going across or you can take out some poles to make it shorter. On the picture I did take out a pole to make sure my backdrop will fit good. It did !! I also bought the backdrop on Amazon !
