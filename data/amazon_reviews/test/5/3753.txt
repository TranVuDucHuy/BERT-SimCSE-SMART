I generally don’t leave reviews so this speaks to how much I love this product. Like many, I had seen the ads on Facebook and was interested but was hesitant because of the $100 price tag. I love my Nintendo switch but my ps5 has spoiled me to fast load times and incredible graphics/performance. I have been praying for a Nintendo switch type product with the power of a console. The backbone gets you just about as close as you can get. With some Christmas money I decided to take the plunge and see if it’s worth the $100 investment. I have not been disappointed. With the PS remote play app, I am sync’d up to my ps5 in a matter of minutes. Wife wants the TV, no problem, I’m on the backbone. Gotta take a dump, no problem, I’m still gaming. I will note that I have an extremely fast cable internet connection with no limit on data usage. Both my phone and my ps5 are pulling internet data to support this and I very rarely run into latency problems. I have yet to try this purely using my cell phone data if I’m out somewhere so I cannot attest to how well it works there. But on my WiFi (and my work WiFi) it works great. I hope that this reviews helps someone who was on the fence like me because of the price tag. As long as you have strong internet, I think you will be happy.
