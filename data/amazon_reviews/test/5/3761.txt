I was worried that this wouldn't be the real thing but, once I received it, I realized that it was perfect. It's an official Apple product and was easy to install. Worked as I put it on my 2nd Gen Apple Pencil. The tips for the 1st and second gen pencils are the same and interchangeable. This is compatible for both. I highly recommend this.
