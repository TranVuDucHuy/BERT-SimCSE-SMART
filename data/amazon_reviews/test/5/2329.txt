For how little these cost I think they’re a great set of earbuds. I had another pair of their earphones, and although that model was a bit better they were also much more expensive. I’ve dropped one of the buds in the sink accidentally and after being fully submerged for a few seconds it still works perfectly fine. The sound quality is great for the price and they last a good 6-8 hours of continuous play which I think is acceptable considering the case charges them within twenty minutes or so. They’re not the best to exist but certainly reliable.
