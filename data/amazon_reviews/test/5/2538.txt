First, I didn't take a picture because the picture of the product is very accurate. This will be the third one of these units I have purchased. Not because they are bad, have broken or any negativity at all, but because I like them and have them in various places. I have one on my desk in my personal space, one on my home office desk and one at my office desk.I have two standard 110 devices, three USBs and one USB-C plugged into one and the charging does NOT seem to be degraded at all. The USB-C charges pretty much (from what I can tell) just as fast as if it was plugged directly into the wall. USBs charge at - well - they are slow anyways so, they also seem normal.The cord is more flat than rounded from the unit to the wall which provides a little more room for a desk to be closer to the wall.The plug for the wall is a flat plug which is very helpful.All in all, I like this product - A LOT - obviously, I have purchased three. Oh, I have had one for about 3 years not and haven't had an issue with it.
