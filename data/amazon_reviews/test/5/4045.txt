I'm 47 years old and I've always owned wired headphones. After getting so tired of untangling the wires all the time, I decided to finally buy some wireless ones. So, I have nothing to compare these against, but I will say that I'm very impressed and satisfied with my purchase. The sound quality and range is great on these. I can go upstairs with my phone down in the kitchen and still have flawless sound. The battery life is fantastic. It pairs quickly. The packaging is nice. The instructions are clear, although the print is very small. The mic works good for phone calls. The case charges the headphones quick and the fit in the ear is comfortable and has never once popped out of my ear or even slipped a little. My only complaints would be that the case itself is a little bit large for putting in your jeans pocket if you want to take it with you. Another thing is that there is a very slight delay when touching the headphone to get it to pause a song. And this impatient person can't wait that one whole second sometimes and so I touch it again and accidentally skip a song. That's more my fault than the company's fault though cause it's literally about one second. Some have complained about accidentally touching it when taking it out if the ear and skipping a song. This is possible and I have done it, but if you grab the sides of it, you can take it out of your ear easily without skipping a song.Overall, a great purchase. Bought my wife a pair as well and she loves them too.
