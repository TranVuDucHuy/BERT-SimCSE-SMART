There were no other options to run a wire around a door, so I decided to give this product a try. It's really easy to work with, cut, and apply. The inside dimensions are just the right size to run both network and power cables through. Be sure to adhere the double sided tape securely to the back before peeling of the paper as the sticky part may stretch. Not a big deal, but just a tip to help it go smoothly.
