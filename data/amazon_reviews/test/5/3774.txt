i got these for about $15 and they are the best ones we own! ive been back for more a few times (kids lose them) and this last time, they were on a black friday deal and i scored a few back up pair too!the sound is good, the noise cancelation is enough that Id be able to get hit by the car behind me before I heard it but cant quite block out my kids screaming enough for me to ignore them fighting.. ya know, not $1000 buds but def $100 quality without that price on my walllet. ive had to take them out a few times to acknowledge things going on around me.best part is, Im not even mad when the kids lose these.here's some points we have noted:I use them at the gym every single day for any where from 1-2 hours, listen to music at work some days for an hour or so, talk on a few calls, my battery life works like this: I usually drop them in the case between uses and charge the case every 2-3 days. the case has not been out of power yet and the buds only ever got as low as the first warning beep one time when i used them almost the entire evening and into the night (think 5pm-11pm). tested them recently, they lasted over 4 days listening to them a lot. they charge up very quick. the call quality is great. never had anyone complain. im using them with an older dinosaur and a brand new galaxy s21, both run perfectly smooth and connect flawlessly. i love the announcements when i first pull them out and put them in my ears. also, my "must have feature" when i bought these was the individual capabilities and they are perfect on that point, better than others. i can control them seperately with no problem. i typically used just one all the time with my old pair to extened battery life but i have mostly used both with these.Side Note:I am just a normal, non tech person who loves listening to music for everything i do, hates listening to gym conversations and people who want to interupt my purpose, hates holding the phone to talk, and thinks people talking to themselves are hilarious. I cannot tell you the exact sound output and i did not time the usage or measure the battery output. i just know they work great for normal everyday usage and im not a brand "wh**e" so these are perfection to me and my wallet for a family of 5!probably important to note the following:- they instantly paired to both of my devices when i opened them and took them out. my device only requires a quick search, click the product you want to pair, and approve the pairing on the phone. simple- i bought several pairs for members of my family who needed replacements and all of our pairs (except the pair witht he bad battery) work well, are the same quality, and seem to be the same battery quality- everyone from 10 years to 23 years, and the adults, are all happy with them- we are all droid users and some phones have no jack, while other can use wired buds also- we have tried expensive ones, wired ones, wireless in other brands, and other cheap sets and all of us have liked these as our #1 or #2 choice (one daughter liked the sound of a more expensive pair but that pair didnt have great battery either)
