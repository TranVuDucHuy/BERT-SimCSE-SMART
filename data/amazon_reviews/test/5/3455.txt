Everything about this tripod so far has been amazing.Sturdy and light for traveling and the base lock mechanismis nice.I've only been using it standing and the remote has been great, button on the side the of remote is to turn on bluetooth.Can be used on apps like snapchat. Click for pic/ Hold button for video.Downside is the pivot for the camera angle since it doesnt go all the way down for sharper angles. Has lots of vertical adjustments to get the right level for your photos or videos. I want to say this stands fully at a little over 5 feet tall. This is really good beginner tripod or for someone needing equipment on a budget. The remote feature in itself is wonderful, I like it a lot- has button for android and iOS. Easy to use.
