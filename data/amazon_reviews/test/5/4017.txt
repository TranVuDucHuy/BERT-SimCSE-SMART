I've had other stands (that remain in 1 position/angle); this is my favorite, to date! Nice, solid weighted base; adjustable phone angle (phone can be positioned in portrait or landscape); adjustable height (although I haven't really relied on this feature). I use it next to my nightstand, my desktop, the kitchen -- it's great! I've since purchased 3 more for myself AND a couple for family members, as well (confident they'll like it as much as I do!).
