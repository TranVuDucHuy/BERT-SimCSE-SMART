This solved a problem at my bedside with multiple cords required to charge several devises consolidating three device charging requirements into one unit. It also takes advantage of the inductive charging feature of iPhones. I don't know how to measure charging speed, but this seems to work well and fills my needs. The only design recommendation I would make is if the device were somehow collapsible, it would be more convenient for travel, but I have not had any issues fitting it into a backpack and th unit is sturdy and well designed. I plan to buy another unit for my office and recommend the product.
