So far, so good for my basic needs: Working great from my Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports), USB-C out to this dongle, passing 1920x1080 FHD @60Hz 30-bit color-depth via HDMI cable to my 24" Dell U2414H UltraSharp's HDMI port. Audio is also working as expected (monitor has a 3.5mm analog audio-out jack). This Anker adapter's aluminum case is barely warm; slightly above room temperature (better than my previous USB-C-to-HDMI dongle that got very hot to the touch). Thanks, Anker!
