While these are very comparable to Bose QC45, they have warmer sound. But the key factor was their ability to cancel surrounding noises in the call. With screaming kids running around, I can still use them to attend meetings. Bose QC 45 do not do a great job in canceling the surrounding noises and their mics pick up noise when folks on other side can here them. Wish they were as comfortable as QC45s. But then they arent as bad either.
