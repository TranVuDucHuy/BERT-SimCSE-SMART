I love this charger! I’ve tried many wireless chargers and this one so far has been the best multi device charger I’ve had yet. I love my Mophie chargers for their power and how fast they charge my devices but I wanted one that charged my iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with the same power and simplicity. This one’s really got it! The output this charger has enables it to fast charge all three devices simultaneously and the fact that I’m able to choose the position I want to charge them in is really nice. The prices I’ve paid for my chargers made me question this one at first but it was so affordable I figured even if it ended up disappointing me it’s not that big of a loss. I’m very happy to say it definitely did not disappoint me and cost very little in comparison with other types or chargers with similar capabilities. And the fact that it doesn’t require you to use the charger that comes with the Apple Watch and you can still use that for charging elsewhere is a major plus!
