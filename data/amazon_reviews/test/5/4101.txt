I’ve been looking for THE best earbuds for my iPhone. Lots of research. Every review for iOS seems to have tunnel vision with the air pods pro 2. Well after being your Guinea pig with these Samsung buds2 pro I am happy to say, these rule.Not only are they incredible sounding, good looking (no white earrings sticking out of your ears and you have options for colors), and super compact- they do all that AirPods Pro 2 do and maybe better. At the least just as good.First off the case is super compact and the buds themselves are tiny, but pack a punch and stay in the ears no prob. Head shaking test passed. The noise canceling and ambient modes are all great. But my use case doesn’t require any of that and it’s easy to turn those options on and off if I end up needing it. They sound perfect with those modes both shut off anyway. And turned off you get 8 hours on these super tiny bangers.The touch controls are perfect - pause, skip song, back song, answer calls, turn on/off sound features. On dynamic sound mode they sound grade A for music. Call test was also incredible so they’re perfect for work or otherwise.The only catch? Need to download the app on a android/windows phone or computer to do a quick update, toggle on the touch controls and shift the sound mode from stock to dynamic. That takes all of 2 minutes and you never have to do it again and settings are all good on any device you connect to there on out.Don’t follow the herd, go your own way. You won’t be disappointed.
