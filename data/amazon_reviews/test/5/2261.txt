Frankly I was skeptical that any phone stand could be well-built and sturdy for a bargain price. I was pleasantly surprised at my purchase. It has pads on the underside that hold it firmly on the desk. It also has pads on the cradle and back to keep the phone in place when on it. Best of all it allows the phone to be charged while in landscape or portrait. I plan to buy a second one for my workshop.
