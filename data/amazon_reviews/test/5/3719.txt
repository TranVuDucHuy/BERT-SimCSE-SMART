I use this micro SD card for archiving FLAC audio files. It serves its purpose well. So far I have about 64Gigs loaded onto it with zero problems. I break up my collection into genres on smaller 32Gig cards for my player because 256Gigs of data is simply too unwieldy to index and sift through in actual usage. But for archiving my whole collection is great !
