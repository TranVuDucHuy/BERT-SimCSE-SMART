This is a great tool! I saw an advertisement for this around black Friday and honestly never even thought about Airpods getting dirty because I don’t use them. My son does though, so I immediately inspected them upon learning about the gook that can build up in there and decided he’s getting this in his stocking because…well, yuck. I couldn’t wait to break it open after Christmas so I could get to all the nooks and crannies in his Airpods. I mean, let’s face it, my teenager does not get excited about cleaning anything; not even what goes in his ears. But I do! Do yourself and/or your kid a favor and spend less than $10 and get the satisfaction knowing he’s putting clean speakers in his ears every day. You won’t regret it. I took a picture of the Airpod to show there’s a line near the bottom which required using the sharp part of the tool to get clean. Everything else was able to be cleaned with the fluffy part of the tool. I labeled the cleaner case so it wouldn’t accidentally get thrown out. Again, I’ll probably be the only one who ever uses it, so it might get mistaken for who knows what, but labeling it will make the chances of it staying around much greater. And if not, I’ll be ordering another tool!
