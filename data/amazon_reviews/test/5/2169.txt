This was a Christmas gift and my husband and son love them. They say the sound is very loud and clear. The only issue are the earbuds don’t fit to snug into the ear like other earbuds. The battery life has been very good haven’t had them run out of battery yet while at work. Other then the earbuds not fitting snug in the ear, I’m happy with my earbuds.
