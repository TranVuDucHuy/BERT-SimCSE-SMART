I bought this for my son to mount under his desk to plug-in all of his cords and electronics. This thing is amazing! It’s very solid and he hasn’t had any problems with plugging in all of his cords into this surge protector. I don’t worry about the circuits getting overloaded and you can tell that this thing will last many years! I love that it can be mounted to the wall so I don’t have to worry about it hanging loose on the carpet in his room. It doesn’t get hot and so far so good! He loves it & now my daughter is asking for one.
