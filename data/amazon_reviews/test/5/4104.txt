Once I got everything set up, these buds give awesome sound. Retention while in use hasn't been a problem. With noise cancelling on, I generally get about 5 hours use before I have to recharge them. The charging case is good for about 3 recharges from 10% to fully charged, and it accepts fast USB C or wireless charging. I can control the buds by touch, or through either my S22 Ultra or my Watch 5 Pro. Yes, I decided to go all Samsung this time out, and, so far, I'm satisfied with the choice.
