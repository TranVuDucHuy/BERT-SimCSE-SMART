The TV is released from the wall by pulling down on straps attached to the bracket. These straps are way too short, and can Not Be Reached once the TV is mounted to the wall. Be certain to attach much longer straps *before* mounting the TV.This is a wonderful mount that is perfect if you want to mount your TV close to the wall. It can be mounted to your wall such that the center of the TV is exactly where you want it, left to right. Some more expensive mounts restrict the left to right placement.
