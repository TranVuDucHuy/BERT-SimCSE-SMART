Does your spouse also complain daily about broken phone cords? Then this is what you're looking for. The first time he complained about apple cords ripping and not working I bought a 6 pack of chargers with high ratings. Did this appease the grouchy spouse? For a bit, until they too started ripping and not charging items. These chargers have pleased the grouchy spouse and I'm making offerings to the phone cord gods that they too won't split and stop working.In all seriousness- they seem to be great chargers. Time will tell. My husband said Anker is suppose to be good quality 🤷🏻‍♀️ let's hope so, because apparently nothing is more frustrating than thinking you charged a device all night and it's in the red when you need it.
