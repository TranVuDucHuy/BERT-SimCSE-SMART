The auxiliary cord provided with the headphones tip breaks very easy. The tip broke off both ends. One end even broke off in my son's tablet and I had to work very hard to get it out. Note to anyone else with this problem, the straw from a thing of can air... if you press the straw down into the aux port, you can use it to grab the tip stuck inside.Other then the auxiliary cord being very cheaply made and causing me a great headache, the sound quality of the head phones is nice.
