Â Not sure if it's original or fake.As per the images shown and in the samsung website and in the internet the case of Galaxy Buds 2 is white and insides are of the color. Here I received one with Matte Grey cover. Wonder if its authentic.Sound is okayish to good. Doesn't go very loud. I have to usually bump up to around 80% to enjoy the music.The mic is not very sensitive and doesn't catch your voice if you speak softly even in quiet room.The ambient mode makes sounds electronic. The noise cancellation is just okay nothing dramatic.Overall okay product not sure if it's authentic though. Haven't quite seem colored case for galaxy buds 2 anywhere else.
