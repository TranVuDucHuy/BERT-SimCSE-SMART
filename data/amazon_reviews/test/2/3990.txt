I bought two of these with the objective of protecting two surge protectors from the treading of two cats. For some reason the cats like to nose around the plugs and power adapters, causing them to unplug just enough to disconnect them from the power. I liked the size and layout of this cable mgmt. box. However, on opening the wrapping, I was disappointed to find that the box is made out of a thin, brittle type of plastic that looks like it will break if it ever dropped. For $20 or so each, I would have expected a sturdier, better quality material.
