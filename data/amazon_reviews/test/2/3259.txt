I can honestly say these were the best Bluetooth earphones Iâ€™ve ever used. Great sound quality and low background noise. Above all, the fit was perfect for exercising. Never fell out during any of my runs (up to 2 hours nonstop) and barely had to adjust them from time to time (probably more of a nervous tick).HOWEVER, after just a couple months the left earphone has stopped charging. The case charges and the right earphone also charges. I expect much better reliability from a product that costs as much as this.I tried scrubbing the contacts and resetting the earphones several times, but nothing will fix the problem. Very annoying.
