For $45 its an "ok" PDU. It funcitons, its finish is what you would expect for a $45 product. The cord is a decent length but if mounted at the top of a 42U rack is a bit short for the outlet on the wall located near floor level at standard height.My biggest complaint the packaging. The PDU was just in a box with no packing material. Both mounting ears were bent in shipping. Its not a huge deal I was able to bend them back but annoying that I had to bend these back on a item I just purchased when a little bubble wrap or carboard would have saved it.
