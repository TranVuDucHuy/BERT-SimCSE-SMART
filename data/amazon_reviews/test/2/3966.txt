I had a musicozy headband prior to this, and after about 10 months, the left speaker died. I was fairly happy with it, so I ordered this one to replace it. First, the speakers barely reach my ears and I'm constantly having to readjust one because it floats forward. Second, I need to recharge it daily, whereas my old one would last 2 days. My son had to replace his, and bought one, and his new set lasts 2 days, so I may have gotten a bad unit. Overall, not as happy with this as I was the previous one that I had, and this made me go invest in some earbuds instead.
