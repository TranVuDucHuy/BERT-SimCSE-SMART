I was recommended these wireless earbuds, and based off the reviews, everything seemed legit. Which is why... maybe???.... I have a defective set? After a month, I just still have the same issues of when I am walking or working out, the sound... crackles? Like with every step, the sound goes in and out in a way. It is so frustrating. I also can't seem to get the right fitting buds even with all of the options provided. The other really frustrating thing is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to turn them off or switch devices from phone to laptop, without completely turning off Bluetooth on the previous device. These are my first BT earbuds so maybe Im just not that great at using them... Definitely need to try something else.
