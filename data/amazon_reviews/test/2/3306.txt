As others had stated, the volume level is way too low. I have every input control on highest setting and I still have to get right up to the microphone. Sound quality is average at best.Finally, I'm not sure the stand was designed for this microphone. The holder is too small, causing the microphone to slip out of its rubber suspension-straps. Plus the pop-screen has to bend at an odd angle to cover the speaking part of the microphone. I believe it was originally designed for a longer, cylinder style microphone.
