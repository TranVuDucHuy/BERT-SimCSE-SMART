I picked this one because I though it would reach my needs but I'm not fully satisfied. I bought the large one and my 15 in macbook pro charger doesn't even fit with the plastic top. I have to use it topless because I'm scared it would break/damage my cable. It was a total wasted of money.So no, I don't recommend this unless you have a windows charger or just used it for phone chargers.
