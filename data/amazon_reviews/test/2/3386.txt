I tried installing this into my printer after opening the vacuum sealed packaging and popping off the seal, and there was no ink. I replaced all the cartridges with ink I bought at the store and they worked fine. The "new" black ink was registering as empty. It also feels lighter than the other new cartridges. So I guess I got a dud and realized too late to return it haha shows how much I print.
