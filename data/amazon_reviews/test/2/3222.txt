I really wanted to like these but they keep falling out of my ear and yes I changed the ear piece hoping it would resolve the issue and nope. I almost lost them twice because ether fell out once while I was cleaning into my sink and another time while I was in the street. I wasn't doing any kind of crazy activity. Samsung I really think you could do better or even make adapters to go over the ear to secure them.
