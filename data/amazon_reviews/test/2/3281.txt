UPDATE 09/02/21: Although I do still love them I can't recommend them anymore for the following reasons:1. I've found issues with disconnecting them from my phones bluetooth then trying to reconnect them to my computer bluetooth it just tells me it can't connect to the P3's. It's a MAJOR pain to disconnect them from your phone, put them back in their case and close it, open it back up and take them out and disconnect them again from my phone when they automatically reconnect to the last device and finally be able to connect to my computer. I don't know if that's the norm? Or if it's something I'm doing but that's been my experience trying to switch between two devices. Not always, but frequently enough to be a problem.2. Along the lines with connectivity issues, I've also had recent problems where they were connected to my phone and I put them in their case for a length of time (anywhere from 15 mins to an hour) and I grab them out of the case walking out the door to start walking expecting that they'll automatically connected like usual but for some reason they don't/wont reconnect for seemingly no reason. The first time it happened I chalked it up to user error but after a 3rd or 4th time I'm starting to suspect it's product. It's easy to reset them with the case but I don't take the case on walks with me so can be SUPER annoying and unusable for the duration of your walk/activity.3. Today after resetting the head phones I connected them to my computer to listen to music while my phone did a system update. I've frequently had it connected to my computer in the past for Zoom calls and listening to music and videos, etc. Normally when connected to the computer I have the same sound quality I do when connected to my phone, however, today for the first time, after connecting it to my computer the sound quality was TERRIBLE. And I don't mean just kind of bad I mean it sounds like a low quality tape recording from the radio coming out of a blown phone speaker in a bowl (When using a streaming service like Spotify or YouTube). I'm SUPER disappointed in them. I don't know if they did an update that f-ed them all up or what but yikes. Due to the recent issue's I've experienced I've reduced my original 5 star rating down to a 2 star. :( Hopefully their next headphone release will be way better. Maybe the Liberty Air Pro 2's are better?I'm new to the Soundcore Brand but after paying $40 dollars for one of there older earbuds and being blown away I figured I'd pay a little more and try a higher quality ear bud from them and....just wow. These are far better than I was expecting. I might be a little easier satisfied than someone who classifies themselves as an 'audiophile' or someone who needs head phones for music production reasons and although the noise cancelling isn't quite as good as my over the ear Sony WH-1000XM4 but the Life P3's are $270 LESS and they're actually pretty darn close. The P3's have a great fit for your ears, I can do yoga while wearing them and they don't fall out. The App is a very nice touch. Nothing worse than trying to figure out what you're doing pushing and holding buttons like on the Life A1's but not knowing what equalizer you're on. Incredible sound and base and they get SUPER LOUD.Pros:~The App - Gives you a battery life indicator for each head phone, Gives you access to Ambient Sound, GamingMode, Equalizer, Controls, Superior sleep sounds, and Tip Fit Test* Gives you 3 ambient sound options Noise Cancellation, Transparency mode, and normal mode. 3 optionsfor noise cancellation - transport, indoor, and outdoor.* Gaming mode - you can turn on to reduce the latency while gaming or watching videos.* Equalizer - gives you the option to custom tune your earbuds or using one of their 21 preset ones.* Controls - lets you customize the touch response on the ear buds to do the controls that you want themost.* Superior Sleep gives you access to 11 ambient sounds to help you fall asleep (although, you're a championif you can fall asleep with these or any other ear buds in.)* Tip Fit Test - Tests the Tip seal on the head phones to make sure you're getting the most out of your earbuds.~ Tip Selection - Like all of Soundcore ear buds a huge selection of ear tip pieces so you can get a comfortable fit.~ Wireless charging case~ Noise Cancellation - is it the best? Probably not. Will it block out a lot of the noise? Absolutely. I used to have toclose my office door every day at work when coworkers would start talking, now my doors wide open and I can'thear any of them.~ Comfort - I was worried that with my ears and everything that they might stick out too far but they sitcomfortably inside of my ear and don't stick out far at all. Looks like I have Air pods in.~ So many color options.Cons: There aren't many that I can find.~ No bluetooth Multipoint (Being able to connect to more than one bluetooth at a time.) This is the biggest confor me. (Don't believe any of the Soundcore ear buds have this yet, but may be wrong.)~ No in ear detection when you remove an ear bud to pause music.~ No HearID in the app - I believe that's because that's a Liberty series feature, so I guess it makes sense it's notincluded.If you're trying to decide between the Liberty Air 2 Pro or the Life P3's I can't see much of a difference between them other than the HearID test. If you have extra money to burn or the HearID is a super important feature you want, I'd honestly stick with the Life P3's and save $50 bucks.I'm hoping on Soundcores next ear bud release will include the in ear detection as well as the multipoint bluetooth connection (Hopefully on the liberty series so I can try the HearID as well).
