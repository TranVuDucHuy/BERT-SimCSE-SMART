I replaced all 3 colors this morning. Magenta and yellow worked; Cyan did not. REPLACE TONER. I followed the directions and tried again and again. Again, REPLACE TONER kept appearing. I went to office depot and bought a single CYAN toner and installed that. THAT worked. I removed it and put in the CYAN from the Amazon order. REPLACE TONER. I chatted with Angel, a rep at BROTHER, this afternoon. She asked me to put in the Amazon CYAN toner. It appears to work but the ink content shows 25% full when it's suppose to show 100% full. Angel said 'problem solved'. Problem is NOT SOLVED. I have a new CYAN toner that is 25% full when I paid for a 100% full toner.Very Very disappointed in BROTHER and their customer service on this issue.
