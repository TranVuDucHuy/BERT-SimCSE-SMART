Great sounding mic, rich and clear without any harshness. Not super high fidelity and not recommended for instruments but great for purely voice recording of a single person.However it's all ruined by the flaw that nobody else has mentioned. When the mic goes into suspend while plugged into USB (aka when you turn off your computer or sleep your laptop) it will only record silence or super loud static until you physically power down the device by unplugging it. If you've got a powered USB hub you can save yourself a little effort by flicking the power switch on the hub but it's still a pain the ass. I've talked to Samson support and have received a second mic from amazon which does the exact same thing. Samson support is clueless and just looked for different ways to blame the problem on my hardware, even though I tested it on multiple computers. Not recommended for use with USB in a permanent setup.
