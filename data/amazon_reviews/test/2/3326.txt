Update, January 14, 2020: The second set also broke within 3 months. Audio stopped working on one side. Will not purchase again.I'm on my second set of these within a year. I found these while looking for earbuds that would be smaller than all the ones I currently had. The low price made them worth a try.I'm SUPER happy with how comfortable they are. I have relatively small ears and I am hypersensitive to physical discomforts that other people aren't very bothered by (or don't feel uncomfortable with at all). I use the smallest cover size that came with them.Even though they aren't actively noise-cancelling, they do block out a considerable portion of ambient noise without having the volume super loud and/or having them jammed tightly in.The mic is not as good as ones on other earbuds that I've used but it works. I'm very happy with the sound quality - I'm not an audiophile but I use them for all kinds of shows, movies, and music, and I seem to hear everything well. I can't tell any difference between them and other moderate-quality earbuds or headphones or speakers (they're definitely better than my device speakers and a cheap bluetooth one I've used).I do wish they had a volume function on the section with the mic. There is one button that will pause or resume what you are watching or listening to but nothing else.The first set of these that I purchased abruptly stopped working on one side after less than 4 months, which wasn't great. However, I was pretty rough on them - I used them nearly all day every day; I yanked them out from under my tablet or out of my overstuffed bag without being careful; I'd shove them in a bag with lots of other stuff and not have them protected. I may have broken a connection or something doing that - can't say for sure. There was no visible damage - no cracks in the cord covering, etc.I love the color selection - I've gotten the purple both times.I've been more careful with my current pair, which I've been using for over 2 months now. I still use them constantly but I try to remember not to yank them around or let stuff sit on them. If I run into problems with this model again soon, I'll update this review.
