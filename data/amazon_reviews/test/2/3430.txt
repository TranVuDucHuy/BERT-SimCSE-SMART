I expected that I would not be able to find a phone holder for my car, ever, because I am very particular with the esthetics of how one would look, work and NOT cause damage. Unfortunately, this holder did cause a bit of the finish on the vent I chose to use so that didn't work for me. Had this holder held securely without causing an issue, I would have kept it as this one did hold my heavy iPhone 13 Pro Max well. I just haven't found a holder that attaches to a vent to be of use. I like a dash mount like my husband has...but not in my car. So, I will just lay the phone in my seat and rely on voice directions when needed :)
