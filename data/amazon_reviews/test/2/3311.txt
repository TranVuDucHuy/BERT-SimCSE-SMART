Initially, the quality was excellent! Very good quality, which I expected for the price I paid.But... after the first time, the product refused to turn on!!! It's supposed to be driven by USB-power only, directly from the laptop (I'm using a MacBook Air). Well, it didn't. Tried several times, discharging overnight, unplugging, turning laptop on/off etc.. Nothing worked!The product literature doesn't give any information on how much current it needs to be powered on etc..Very frustrating. I really wanted to like it, but had to return it due to it's complete disregard for my intent ;)Good luck to those of you who want to use it with a laptop. Hope you have better luck than me!
