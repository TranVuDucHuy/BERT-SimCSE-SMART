On the very first day of receiving it my second dog chewed the other dogs cover and so the AirTag fell out. luckily I found it, but I needed to get one that covered everything and was more durable. I bought silicone ones that went completely over the tag a man inside another silicone case. The case was thin and didn’t stay snapped into each other so it just didn’t work for me.
