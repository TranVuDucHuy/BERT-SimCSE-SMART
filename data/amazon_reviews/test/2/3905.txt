After rearranging my living room, I realized that I would prefer to have my TV at an angle to my couch, while still having the option of have it straight on should I change my mind. In comes this swivel TV stand. Putting it together wasn't too bad and was relatively straight forward. Of course because I bought it to primarily have my TV at an angle, that's the way I positioned it right after putting it together. After receiving it on a Monday, I went to rotate it back to straight on today and noticed the TV was leaning to the side that it was angled towards. Today is Sunday. After less than a week, the stand is failing to the point that the TV is no longer level. I have a 62" LED and ensured it was well within the maximum lengths for the VESA mounts. Additionally, I ensured all bolts were tight. I'll deal with it for the time being because I don't have another stand for my TV. In my photos, you'll see that there is little to no light under the TV to the right while there is plenty on the left. I wouldn't recommend it for the larger, but within limits, televisions.
