I bought this headset for the unique charging case as I was planning to transport it from place to place. While it looks cool, the way the headset fits into the pod makes it really difficult to get back out.. i had to use a pen to pop it out of it's holder as there is not a lot of room to fit even smaller fingers under and the pod holds on tight to the headset.I'm sad to say as well that audio quality is very poor. Even in a quiet room I found it difficult to hear callers clearly and in turn callers stated that it sounded like I was talking through a tin can on speaker phone. I did attempt to edit my sound settings, using both hands-free mode and surround sound mode, but to no avail.Additionally, and perhaps just a personal issue as everyone's ears are different, the design of the ear piece hits right up against the side of the ear canal causing pain after just 20 minutes of use. I did try all the sizes of ear buds and attempted to power through 4 hours of use, but it proved to be too painful to keep in which is odd considering my ears are usually just fine with any other in-ear headset I've come across. Perhaps if the maker switched to memory foam buds it could help.In short, it is a nice concept, just executed poorly in my opinion. As much as I really wanted it to, it just didn't work for my needs.
