The product arrived in its box, showing a good deal of wear and tear on the packaging. When I opened it, I found immediately that both sets of rack "ears" were badly bent. This product may have gone through a great deal during shipping and I am cautiously going to test it for use before I leave it to operate. Not impressed with this situation and I'll write a further review pending an opportunity to plug it in and operate it for a while. Update - it didn't work at all.
