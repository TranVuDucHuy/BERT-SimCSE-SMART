Got this less than a year ago and only recently started using it (about 2x a week at the gym) for 3 months and the foam is already starting to break down. It’s leaving black pieces everywhere. I liked it bc it helped the pros actually stay in my ears but I noticed it’s been slipping out more often. I assume it’s bc the foam is breaking down.
