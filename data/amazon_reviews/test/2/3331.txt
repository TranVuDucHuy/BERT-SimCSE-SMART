If been looking into an additional JBL flip 4 (used) on offer up to pair together. Because we love our little speaker! Crispy highs, fair mids, and surprisingly tight and powerful lows. I’ve gone through quiet a few and although I don’t consider myself an audiophile, I have installed my fair share of sound systems in 4+ cars, enjoy the science and research behind audio setups, 5+ different Bluetooth speakers of multiple portability tiers, etc.My daughter and I go for little bike rides around the city and normally it’s just me with the speaker loud enough for her to hear the ambient or bleed out sound. But that means it’s loud (and unsafe) for me to bike just for her to hear some music. So, I’d rather buy two (one on my bike one on Hers) and keep the volume low enough to hear oncoming traffic and other environmental sounds.Long story short, I came across these speakers and buying the pair was cheaper than a used flip, so why not? The build of the speaker is beautiful! I’m super impressed on this aspect, nice tight lids press fit for water resistance, smooth edges, and really nice aesthetics. But the sound, even wife noticed, cannot compare to the sound quality of the flip 4. Enough for me to feel and hear the distinct difference. The highs are pushed through and lost with mids. Mids overpower the lows, and the highs get lost in this mix. It hits nice lows, but only at higher volumes does the bass resonate nicely. The JBL can power a good low even at lower volumes. Overall, we aren’t entirely happy with the purchase since the main objective was to save money on getting a good sounding paired Bluetooth speaker. The JBL spoiled our sound preference and so this speaker underperformed for us.We also take these speakers to hotels to play music as we get ready.
