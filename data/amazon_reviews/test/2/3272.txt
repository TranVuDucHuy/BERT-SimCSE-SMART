Had I written this review right after I received this, I would have been congratulating myself on not paying $50 for a phone cup holder. This one seemed to do the trick at a fraction of the price of the more expensive ones like a WeatherTech. And it worked great and really improved my commute!Then today, I was straightening it and the flexible stalk snapped right out the base. Now, I’ll buy a higher quality one with a warranty and it will end up costing me more than had I just bought the quality product to begin with.Don’t buy garbage. Buy a good one and be done with it. (This isn’t the good one.)
