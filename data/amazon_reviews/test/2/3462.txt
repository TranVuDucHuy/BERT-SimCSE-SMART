Purchased a pair of the Amazon Basics USB 3.0 Extension Cable - A-Male to A-Female Extender Cord - 6 Feet (2 Pack). Neither would function as the expected extender on multiple TV's I experimented with; USB stick works without the cable, but fails with the cable attached, each and every time. I would return, but tossed the box away. I've now ordered the 2.0 version in hopes of success. (These DO function well as extenders on a PC, USB 3.0, but that's not what I bought them for.)
