These cartridges claim to get about 260 pages, but in my experience printing very low volume, I average about 15-20 pages per month. This cartridge literally has to be replaced every two months or the printer refuses to do anything. Does the ink simply evaporate or dry up when not in use? How can it yield so little? Same for the standard color cartridges. I don't print photos, just text documents that have colored text and the colors are almost a monthly replacement for the simple printing I do. Going to try the XL cartridges, and looks like other brands are a fraction of the cost with significantly higher yield reported by actual reviews.
