I bought this speaker because my previous speaker of the same size that I had for 5 years fell off a boat. I was expecting similar quality when I got this speaker but I'm a bit disappointed. It's not bad. The battery life is not long at all. I use the speaker throughout the work day and I feel like I need to plug it in all the time. Also if your phone isn't close by sometimes the sound has a bit of static. It's cute and very portable but just not the best speaker!
