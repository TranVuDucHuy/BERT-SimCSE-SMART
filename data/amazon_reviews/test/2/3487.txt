The pros. Seems well made, the digital percent of charge (both headset and charging case) is nice. Comes with 6 different size earpieces, though due to the angle adjustment range of the earpiece in relation to the boom and ear clip, there doesn't seem to be a setting that doesn't become uncomfortable after wearing it for half an hour. This may be a personal thing, of course, but I've owned dozens of headsets and this is the first with this problem.If you suffer from even mild high frequency hearing loss, this is not the one for you. Low frequencies seem to be boosted by the volume control but this makes deeper male voices difficult to understand - again, never had a problem with other headsets.Finally, the unit comes with a "scratch off" gift card. "First prize" is a free second headset. Notify them via email of the prize you just won, and you are instructed how to claim your prize, simply leave a 5 star review and then send them the URL. This headset *does* get a lot of 5 star ratings after all. But unfortunately not from me, I returned it.
