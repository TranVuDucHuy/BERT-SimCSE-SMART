I bought these for work, in black, because I was tired of my white Apple earbuds always showing the dirt, and I didn't feel like forking over $30+ for some earbuds. I realized though there's a reason Apple charges $30. ;) They've got the market cornered on sound quality for such tiny little things you stick in your ears. The sound quality on these ones though are very tinny/lacking bass and depth. It's disappointing, because they're Panasonic, so you'd think they'd have it mastered. I would not want to use them for listening to actual music, like at the gym, or when biking. I only use them to listen to voicemail messages at work, or to watch an occasional video at work.
