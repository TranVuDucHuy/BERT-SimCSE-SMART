I had the Jaybird Vista (original) headphones for years and they were generally the best pair I have ever had. Super durable and had no issues. I even put them through the washer/dryer on accident once and they still worked fine. Also one got tossed out of my ear once when I got hit by a car while on a bike ride, and still it was fine. Truly fantastic product. After years the speaker in one of the headphones died so I decided to upgrade to the Vista 2.Unfortunately they added some features in the new Vista 2 headphones that just don't work well. The headphones have an auto-pause feature that pauses your music when you pull a headphone out of your ear. However this feature is fairly poorly tuned. It uses an accelerometer to sense when you remove it from your ear. If you remove a headphone the music pauses, then if you put the headphone down on the table, it thinks that it is back in your ear and the music continues. If I remove both headphones, it gets into a weird state where the headphones will no longer play music from my phone no matter what I do. The only solution is to put both headphones back into the case and reconnect to them. This is pretty annoying if you're on a run and don't have the case with you.You can turn the auto-pause feature off in the app, but that didn't actually change the behavior of the headphones for me, so the app seems to be bugged for that feature. They still auto-pause even though the app says it is turned off. Then if I reconnect to the headphones, the app says that the feature is on again.What's most annoying is that you can pause the music by pressing the button built into the headphone, so why does it need to auto-pause when my finger is literally on the button that pauses it when I am removing a headphone?If you can find the original Vistas anywhere, get those. Unfortunately they seem to be sold out everywhere.
