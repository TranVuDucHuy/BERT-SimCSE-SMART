Product splits at the point where the cable meets the plastic housing. I was not rough on the cable. Also noticed the start of a burn mark farther up the plastic housing near where it connects with a lightening port. Had cable for about a year. Big disappointment. I specifically bought this product because of its claims to be durable. At this point, I have had to trash 2 out of 4 of these identical cables I purchased over the past 2 years. A 50% fail rate is too high for me. Manufacturer needs to adjust their durability claims. Yes, these are definitely better than most of the cheap junk sold on Amazon but for this price they should last a lot longer and be safe.
