Comply is a big name in making compatible ear tips for many earphones. I had good experience with tips for Jabra and Sony branded earphones. However, apple AirPods Pro has been utter disappointment. First, the design of the AirPods makes it a little difficult to make these ear tips, however it's made worse by the design decision (cutting corners) by Comply. As you can see in the picture, the housing is plastic and very cheap one. It ends up breaking very easily. When you reach out to customer service (Zendesk) their stance is that this is only suppose to last 90 days. WHAT???? I would avoid this company until they stand behind their product as these tips are the most expensive of them all. AVOID
