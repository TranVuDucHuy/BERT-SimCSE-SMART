I have to unplug it and plug it back in every time I turn the computer on, the threaded holes are too recessed to get the screws on the VGA plug in at all, and the HDMI plug is barely too small so it likes to fall out. Also, I'm 99% sure its made by the same company that makes the 'onn' brand for Walmart. I bought this one as a hopeful replacement and everything besides the sticker on it is the exact same.
