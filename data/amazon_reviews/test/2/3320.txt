You’re much better off getting the mic by itself and the accessories separately as well. AT did this dumb thing where in order to replace the XLR cable, you need to replace the whole stand unless your cool with a broken cable just dangling underneath the mic (my XLR cable wasn’t working out the box, but other xlr cables worked so my DAC and the mic itself are fine)
