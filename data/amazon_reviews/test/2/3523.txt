I saw an ad on FB for this and thought that this would be a perfect solution to my problem with plugging in my charging cable. I had debtis, like horse hay, getting into my charging port and this is not easy to solve. The problem with solution is that most of us use a phone case to protect the phone. The case doesn't allow the magnetic charging piece to fully insert into the phone. With this issue, this product is not viable and doesn't work. If you don't use a case, this product is for you. Not so much for me. I actually purchased these as Christmas gift stocking stuffers, what a dud.
