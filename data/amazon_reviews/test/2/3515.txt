Although I purchased this on 5/15 (do not drive so like to have extras on hand), I installed it on 9/14 and it lasted until 10/18. I'm elderly, at home, and only print some e-maisl and short articles for reading (poor eyesight). This is the second time in a row that a yellow toner cartilage has lasted just over one month. As they have only a 90 days warranty, cannot now return. Do not stockpile these cartridges!
