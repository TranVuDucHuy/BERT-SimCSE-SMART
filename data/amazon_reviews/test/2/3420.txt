This was the Second Charger I tried for my Galaxy S6. This one works a lot better than the first one, an Opracle Charger. The things I don't like about this charger is that the status lights are not always on when charging. The Standby Light is red, not as described in the literature, but that light does stay on all the time when it's in the non-charging mode. The back is a bit high and the rear camera protrudes on the S6, so the phone doesn't sit flat, as it did on the Opracle unit.But, hey it works. The charging is fast and it is working well with my Samsung Adaptive Wall Charger.Edit - This charger started having a problem a week after I started using it. From time to time, average about once every other day, it will lose contact with the phone, the red light will flash and the phone will discharge. I contacted the seller directly and they sent a replacement unit. The replacement has the same problem, but the issue happens more frequently. I contacted the seller again, 4 days ago, and have not had a response. I returned the unit to Amazon, and ordered my third charger, this one from ABOX. Let's hope the third times the charm.I have reduced my star rating from 4 to 2 stars, because even though it works most of the time, I can't depend on it.2nd Edit - The ABOX unit works fine, but lacks a "StandBy" status light. NANAMI did contact me right after I completed the first edit. They have sent me another unit, same brand, different model. I received it this AM. After a few hours, it is working fine. Will see what more usage brings.3rd Edit - The third NANAMI unit, Fast Wireless Charger, NANAMI Qi Charger Wireless Charging Stand, I still working just fine. I will be reviewing that one and will be giving it 5 stars.
