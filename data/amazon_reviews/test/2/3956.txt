It's pretty light, which works fine if you're only using it as a selfie stick; although holding the folded end will be difficult for long. As for the professionalism of this device, it's just not. The device is way too light and not a wide enough base to hold up in any kind of wind at all. If you're using an expensive phone or camera, choose a different one because this one WILL fall over with any type of weight atop of it. The base is quite small and the device is light. Extended very far, this will tip over if not perfectly straight. If extended at all, this device will not stand up in any kind of wind whatsoever. If doing indoor filming without the chance of having any type of breeze or anyone bumping into this, it MAY work. Or as a selfish stick, though the folded end will make your hand wear quickly due to its size. If using outdoors, just get a better tripod. To call this professional is just wrong, it's not. Too late to return this, so I'll be selling it at a yard sale. I regret my purchase, even at $15.
