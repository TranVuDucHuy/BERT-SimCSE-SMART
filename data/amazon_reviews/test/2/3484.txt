I ordered this product to use for remote work. I work remotely for a call center and noise-canceling for the headset is a must. Unfortunately, the headset is nowhere near canceling out noise. I had clients tell me they could hear my dogs and vacuum cleaner going in the background (my daughter cleaning the living room) but my office is in the back of the house with a closed door! I am sending it back and I will continue my search for a headset that is wireless, noise canceling, and comfortable to wear for 8hrs a day.
