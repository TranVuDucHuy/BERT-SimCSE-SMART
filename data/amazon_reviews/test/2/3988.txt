I knew it would be plastic but I didn’t realize it was just some thin flimsy plastic cut out as a box. For $25 I expected something more sturdy. Also it doesn’t lock at all, you put the top on it and if you bump it with your feet or the cords inside untangle it’ll just pop the top off. Wish I just bought a metal one or at least something that locks the top on. This is pretty pathetic...
